<div class="para" id="sec-writing-explanations-to-present-models-to-others-2">Doing mathematical work, and presenting that mathematical work, are two related yet different tasks. Moreover, mathematical work is just one part of the bigger process of building a model, justifying the assumptions within the model, determining the possible outcomes of the model, and explaining the possible solutions and outcomes of the model. In this section, we discuss the presentation of modeling results through careful writing and organization.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec-writing-explanations-to-present-models-to-others-3">Students who take a course in modeling sometimes come from a mathematical background in which explanations are sparse. A question such as “What is the value of <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> times <span class="process-math">\(5~\text{?}\)</span>” may not require any explanation. (A more fun question might be, “What are two different ways to demonstrate that <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> times <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> equals <span class="process-math">\(15~\text{?}\)</span>”. How would your approach to responding change if the question were phrased this way?) My experience teaching a variety of math courses is that students have not always experienced the value of explanation, prior to a modeling course. We address this directly so that each student’s models make the most sense, and the impacts of each model are as meaningful and powerful as they can be.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec-writing-explanations-to-present-models-to-others-4">We have discussed writing and presentation already in this text, and we will continue to do so throughout. Notably, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "ch-writing-tips-for-math-and-planning-for-peer-review" missing or not unique]</code> focuses entirely on writing, specifically when writing mathematics and writing about mathematical models. Within this chapter, our focus is on unifying these four components of modeling: a logical approach, clearly stated priorities, making any appropriate changes to a model, and constructing meaningful explanations of the results of our models.

Write out your reasons for the modeling decisions you make. Ideas to consider include: which compartmental model?

What ranges of values may be possible for initial values and parameter values? There may be yet other aspects of your model to describe and explain.</div></li>

<div class="para" id="activity-writing-explanations-to-present-models-1-2-2-1">Ask some questions of your model. Two sample questions are, “What happens if the campus vastly increases its number and distribution of hand sanitizing stations?” and “How much do the model’s results change as the initial number of infectious people changes?”. There are many other questions you can ask. Use Python code blocks from elsewhere in the text to answer your questions. Select a code block that includes the type of model you are using (such as SIR, SEIR, and possibly vaccination) and make whatever changes you need.</div>
<div class="para" id="activity-writing-explanations-to-present-models-1-2-2-2">Once you have addressed each question, write about your results. Include information about what question you asked and why it was a reasonable question, given the outbreak being studied. In addition to writing your response using words, incorporate other evidence, such as graphs and long-term values of Susceptibles or other compartments. Think throughout about structuring your response logically; indicating your priorities; explaining the change you made and why you made it; and explaining what happened when you made that change.</div>

This book does not require readers to have any one opinion about vaccine usage. We use models to address questions about vaccines, and readers are invited to do the same, building models that represent different vaccine-based outcomes and using those models to determine outcomes and dynamics of COVID-19, with and without vaccines.</div></details> The plan was for vaccines to address COVID-19 in multiple ways; we will address two such ways here. One way was for people to be less likely to get COVID-19. Another way was to reduce the severity or length of time ill for people who did get COVID-19. For each of these ways of addressing COVID-19: which compartments and/or parameters in the SEIR model are affected? Prepare before-and-after versions of the model, carefully defining each compartment and parameter in the before model and again in the after model. Then use the Python graph to generate graphs comparing the outcomes before and after vaccines.</div></li>

The code block includes sections titled “original model” and “your changes to the model”: scroll through to the “your changes to the model” version to make updates. Then go to the “plotting commands” section to choose the compartments for which you would like to show graphs; the default is to show I(t) for both the original and updated versions. Notice that if you were to show all four compartments, before and after, there would be eight total curves, which can be complicated for a reader to understand. Instead, prioritize the graphs that best illustrate your findings, probably showing no more than two or four total graphs at a time.</div>
