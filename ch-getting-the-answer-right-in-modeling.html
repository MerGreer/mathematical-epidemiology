<div class="para" id="p-595">Doing mathematical work, and presenting that mathematical work, are two related yet different tasks. Moreover, mathematical work is just one part of the bigger process of building a model, justifying the assumptions within the model, determining the possible outcomes of the model, and explaining the possible solutions and outcomes of the model. In this section, we discuss the presentation of modeling results through careful writing and organization.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-596">Students who take a course in modeling sometimes come from a mathematical background in which explanations are sparse. A question such as ‚ÄúWhat is the value of <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> times <span class="process-math">\(5~\text{?}\)</span>‚Äù may not require any explanation. (A more fun question might be, ‚ÄúWhat are two different ways to demonstrate that <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> times <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> equals <span class="process-math">\(15~\text{?}\)</span>‚Äù. How would your approach to responding change if the question were phrased this way?) My experience teaching a variety of math courses is that students have not always experienced the value of explanation, prior to a modeling course.

One way was for people to be less likely to get COVID-19. Another way was to reduce the severity or length of time ill for people who did get COVID-19. For each of these ways of addressing COVID-19: which compartments and/or parameters in the SEIR model are affected? Prepare before-and-after versions of the model, carefully defining each compartment and parameter in the before model and again in the after model. Then use the Python graph to generate graphs comparing the outcomes before and after vaccines.</div></li>

That is, truly think through this in your mind, and write down your thoughts, before proceeding with changes. For reference, the values in the original model are based very loosely on Lombardy, Italy, in early 2020. The total population was approximately ten million. The value of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> was estimated to be <span class="process-math">\(2.6-3.3\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\kappa\)</span> is estimated at about <span class="process-math">\(1/6.5\text{.}\)</span><a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref fn-knowl original" data-refid="hk-fn-56" id="fn-56"><sup>‚Äâ6‚Äâ</sup></a> The value of <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(1/14\text{,}\)</span> indicating an average of two weeks of being infectious. This is based on many reports suggesting that most people were infectious for one to two weeks, but that some people were infectious for much longer. There was vast variation on how early COVID-19 affected people, which is part of the reason we need to consider changes and updates to models.</div> <div class="para" id="p-610">Next, try your changes in Python, creating before-and-after graphs. The code block includes sections titled ‚Äúoriginal model‚Äù and ‚Äúyour changes to the model‚Äù: scroll through to the ‚Äúyour changes to the model‚Äù version to make updates. Then go to the ‚Äúplotting commands‚Äù section to choose the compartments for which you would like to show graphs; the default is to show I(t) for both the original and updated versions. Notice that if you were to show all four compartments, before and after, there would be eight total curves, which can be complicated for a reader to understand. Instead, prioritize the graphs that best illustrate your findings, probably showing no more than two or four total graphs at a time.</div>
