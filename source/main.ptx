        <title>To Students: How to Get the Most from This Text</title>
        
        <p>
          Dear students working from this text: I hope you enjoy and learn a lot from these pages! My plan when writing has been to encourage active learning. This means that written explanations are kept to a minimum, and there are lots of chances for you to try things on your own or with other students. The book is filled with applications to real outbreaks; examples inspired by outbreaks; and applications to ideas that do not involve epidemics at all, but that can be represented by similar mathematics as what we use to study diseases. The types of mathematical models studied in this text are used currently in the world, by people making decisions about public policy and for other wide-reaching goals, and I want you to emerge from using this text with a strong sense of what these models can, and cannot, tell us.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chapters in this text are typically structured in a consistent way.     
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The <em>Goals</em> of the chapter appear at the very start.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              After a brief introduction, an <em>Exploration</em> activity asks you to engage with questions that motivate the rest of the chapter.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The sections within the chapter include some reading for you to do, and <em>Activities</em> appear frequently. It is best if you do these activities when they appear: many activities contain new information, rather than just examples, and later reading will assume you have already completed the activities. Some activities include hints or answers, and you will learn the most by completing as much of the activity as you can before checking the hints or reading the answers.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              At the end of each chapter, there are questions <em>For Further Thought</em> that provide deeper insights or additional examples of the chapter's ideas.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The <xref ref="glossary-of-terms"/> near the end of the book includes descriptions of key terms, along with the chapter in which each term first appears.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are footnotes in this book, appearing as a raised number.<fn>Here is an example of a footnote!</fn> In the web version of the book, clicking on the raised number shows the footnote in a box that opens below the paragraph. The web version of the book also contains live links. Some of the links, such as to chapters, take you to different pages of the book. Other links, such as to figures or equations that we saw earlier in the text, open a box showing these figures or equations directly where you are reading, so that you can see them without jumping from webpage to webpage. You will also see Python code boxes in this text, with a button after that says <c>Evaluate (Sage)</c>. In the web version of this text, you can click on the <c>Evaluate (Sage)</c> button to evaluate the code directly within the book.  
        </p>
        <p>
          For readers using an electronic PDF of this book, many things are similar to the web version, but the live links to equations and figures will lead to the original location of those items within the text, rather than opening them within a box within the page you are reading. 
        </p>
        <p>          
          For anyone not using the web version of this text, the Python code will not run directly, which requires you to set up some way to run Python on your computer. There are many ways to do this. Suggestions include (and are not limited to): copying the code directly into the box at the top of the page at <url href="https://sagecell.sagemath.org/">sagecell.sagemath.org</url>, using Google Colab at <url href="https://colab.research.google.com/">colab.research.google.com</url>, or downloading an installation of Python directly from <url href="https://www.python.org/">python.org</url>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last but not least: I will not tell you how to think. Mathematical modeling involves setting priorities and incorporating personal values, and each person gets to decide these for themselves.  This book focuses on the processes of developing and describing models, stating and supporting your assumptions, and understanding and explaining your model's outcomes. The mathematics certainly needs to be correct, and all the processes should be done carefully, but priorities and values are personal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for reading!

          <title>Basic Reproduction Number</title>
          <p>
            The basic reproduction number is the average number of new infections caused by one infectious person in an otherwise entirely susceptible population. The symbol <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m>, pronounced <q>R zero</q> or <q>R nought</q>, represents the concept of the basic reproduction number, both in writing and in mathematical formulas.  (Defined in Chapter 5, with a very brief mention at the end of Chapter 4)

          <title>Compartmental Diagram</title>
          <p>
            A compartmental diagram is an image, typically consisting of labeled boxes and arrows, that visually represents the flow of individuals through a <em>compartmental model</em>. Examples include <xref ref="fig-SI-compartmental-diagram"/> and <xref ref="fig-SIR-compartmental-diagram"/>. (Chapter 4)
          </p>
        </gi>

        

        <gi>
          <title>Compartmental Model</title>
          <p>
            A compartmental model is a style of mathematical model in which the subjects of the model are grouped into categories called <em>compartments</em>. Such a model follows the overall outcomes for each compartment, but does not typically track the outcomes of smaller groups such as individuals. The compartmental models in this text use differential equations to demonstrate the interactions and rates governing how many individuals move from one group to another at specific points in time.  As one example of a compartmental model, an SIR model consists of three compartments: S, I, and R. Most often in this text, compartment S represents Susceptible individuals, compartment I represents Infectious individuals, and compartment R represents Removed individuals. (Chapter 4)
          </p>
        </gi>

        

        <gi>
          <title>Compartments</title>
          <p>
            In most models within this text, individuals are placed into categories called compartments. The individuals can typically move out of some compartments and into others, and the differential equations in compartmental models are sets of rules for the ways in which individuals are able to make such moves between compartments.  (Chapter 4)
          </p>
        </gi>

        <gi>
          <title>Continuous</title>
          <p>
            We tend to think of real-world time as continuous, meaning time does not keep stopping and starting. The compartmental models we use in most of this book show continuous time. While this sense of time matches the real world, we need to think about how to reconcile it with data sets, which typically involve discrete time steps, such as days or weeks.  (Chapter 2)
          </p>
        </gi>


        <gi>
          <title>Discrete</title>
          <p>
            We can think of time as discrete when we describe it as separate steps, such as Day 0, Day 1, or Day 2. Many data sets we work with report data in discrete time steps, such as by day or by week. We need to think through how to reconcile discrete data sets with the continuous models we most often use in this text. (Chapter 2)
          </p>
        </gi>
        

        <gi>
          <title>Effective Reproduction Number</title>
          <p>
            The effective reproduction number is the average number of new infections caused by one infectious person in a population that is not entirely susceptible. The most common reason for a population to not be entirely susceptible is when some of the people have some form of immunity. Reasons for immunity may include vaccination and/or some of the people in the population previously having the disease being studied. The symbol <m>\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}}</m> represents the effective reproduction number. (Chapter 6)
          </p>
        </gi>


        <gi>
          <title>Effectiveness</title>
          <p>
            A measure of how many people within a population of vaccinated individuals get a disease, compared with how many people within a comparable population of unvaccinated individuals get the same disease, <em>in real-world conditions</em>. For instance, if after a vaccine has been released to the public <m>90\%</m> fewer vaccinated people get the virus than do those who are unvaccinated, then the vaccine is said to have an effectiveness of <m>90\%</m>. (Chapter 6)
          </p>
        </gi>
        

        <gi>
          <title>Efficacy</title>
          <p>
            A measure of how many people within a population of vaccinated individuals get a disease, compared with how many people within a comparable population of unvaccinated individuals get the same disease, <em>in a clinical trial</em>. For instance, if in trials <m>70\%</m> fewer people in the vaccinated group get a virus than do those in the unvaccinated group, then the vaccine is said to have an efficacy of <m>70\%</m>.  (Chapter 6)
          </p>
        </gi>

        
        <gi>
          <title>Graphical Solution</title>
          <p>
            A graphical solution to a differential equation, or system of differential equations, is a curve or curves showing the behavior of the differential equation(s), based on specific parameter values and initial conditions. When parameter values change, or when initial conditions change, the graphical solution typically changes as well. A graphical solution is often called a <em>solution</em>, and readers should use context to know whether the word <em>solution</em> refers to a graphical solution, a numerical solution, or a formula. (Chapter 3)
          </p>
        </gi>

        
        <gi>
          <title>Initial Conditions</title>
          <p>
            Initial conditions are the starting values of the dependent variables in differential equations. Within this text, our dependent variables are typically populations such as <m>S(t)</m> or <m>I(t)</m>, and the start of solutions is usually the time <m>t=0</m>. This means the initial conditions are the values <m>S(0)</m> and <m>I(0)</m>. Initial conditions are used when computing a numerical solution: the numerical solution begins with the initial conditions and then <q>steps through</q> time, computing the later values of each dependent variable using both the earlier values and the information in the differential equations about how each dependent variable changes. (Chapter 3)
          </p>
        </gi>

        
        <gi>
          <title>Mathematical Modeling</title>
          <p>
            Mathematical modeling is a process by which we represent real-world dynamics using mathematical formulas. In this text, we typically use differential equations in our models. The process of mathematical modeling can require many steps, such as choosing which equations to use, comparing the results of a model with data, updating a model as needed to respond to different goals, and considering multiple models to best answer the questions we are asking. (Chapter 7)
          </p>
        </gi>


        <gi>
          <title>Numerical Solution</title>
          <p>
            A numerical solution to a differential equation, or system of differential equations, is a set of lists of numbers that result from approximating the outcome of the differential equation(s), given specific parameter values and initial conditions. When parameter values change, or when initial conditions change, the numerical solution typically changes as well. The lists of numbers for an SIR model, for instance, typically show the values of <m>S(t)</m>, <m>I(t)</m>, and <m>R(t)</m> at many values of time <m>t</m> within the range of time values of interest. We may print some or all of the values in the lists, or we may use graphing to present the information in the lists. A numerical solution is often called a <em>solution</em>, and readers should use context to know whether the word <em>solution</em> refers to a graphical solution, a numerical solution, or a formula. (Chapter 3)
          </p>
        </gi>


        
        <gi>
          <title>Parameters</title>
          <p>
            Parameters in a model are numbers, determined using biological information, that represent some aspect of how a disease progresses. In this text, most parameters are shown as Greek letters, such as <m>\beta</m> or <m>\gamma</m>. A few parameters in this text represent percentages, such as the percentage of a population that is vaccinated against a disease, and these parameters are typically represented by lowercase letters such as <m>p</m> or <m>q</m>. Parameters are different than variables: the variables in our models are typically the independent variable <m>t</m> for time, and dependent variables such as <m>S</m>, <m>I</m>, <m>R</m>, and others, for populations.  (Chapter 4)
          </p>
        </gi>

        
        
        <gi>
          <title>Rate</title>
          <p>
            A rate is, in general, a ratio between two different things. In this text, rates are parameters having units <m>1/\text{time}</m>. In a model, the rate is typically multiplied by a population such as <m>I</m> or <m>R</m> to show the flow of that population out of one compartment and into another compartment. (Chapter 4)
          </p>
        </gi>

        
        <gi>
          <title>Sign Analysis</title>
          <p>
            The word <q>sign</q> in sign analysis refers to whether terms in differential equations are positive (<m>+</m>), negative (<m>-</m>), or zero (<m>0</m>). In sign analysis, we use these signs to build understanding of the differential equation. Often, our goal is to learn whether the solution to the differential equation is rising, falling, or level at some time <m>t</m>. This understanding may help us identify which solution curve goes with which differential equation, may show when a disease starts with an outbreak or can never experience an outbreak, and may indicate many other outcomes of models. Sign analysis is powerful because it depends only on the signs of terms, without forcing us to rely on detailed data sets that may not always be available. (Chapter 5)

          <title>SI Model</title>
          <p>
            An SI model is a compartmental model having two compartments, labeled S and I. Most often in this text, S stands for <em>Susceptible</em> and I stands for <em>Infectious</em>, though the compartments can have other interpretations. The letters S and I are each pronounced when we say <q>SI model</q>: <q>Ess</q> <q>Eye</q> model. (Chapter 2)

          <title>SEIR Model</title>
          <p>
            An SEIR model is a compartmental model having four compartments, labeled S, E, I, and R. Most often in this text, S stands for <em>Susceptible</em>, E stands for <em>Exposed-and-incubating</em>, I stands for <em>Infectious</em>, and R stands for <em>Removed</em>, though the compartments can have other interpretations. The letters S, E, I, and R are each pronounced when we say <q>SEIR model</q>: <q>Ess</q> <q>Eee</q> <q>Eye</q> <q>Arr</q> model. (Chapter 6)

          <title>SIR Model</title>
          <p>
            An SIR model is a compartmental model having three compartments, labeled S, I, and R. Most often in this text, S stands for <em>Susceptible</em>, I stands for <em>Infectious</em>, and R stands for <em>Removed</em>, though the compartments can have other interpretations. The letters S, I, and R are each pronounced when we say <q>SIR model</q>: <q>Ess</q> <q>Eye</q> <q>Arr</q> model. (Chapter 4)

          <title>Total Population</title>
          <p>
