        <title>Preface</title>
        
        
        <p>
          Welcome to Mathematical Epidemiology and More: A Course on Compartmental Models. It so happens that this book is becoming available well after the start of the global COVID-19 outbreak. During this pandemic, mathematics, data, epidemiology, graphs, models, and charts began appearing in the news and other media at levels beyond what we had ever seen before. To fully appreciate and act on the information in the media, it has been helpful to know first-hand the ways models can be built, used, and misused, and to understand the underlying mathematics involved. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet this text's origin lies not in the COVID-19 outbreak, but in the much longer history of mathematical epidemiology. The text builds on a course that has been taught since 2014, and typical students studying these topics pre-2020 had never heard of connections between mathematics and epidemiology. Nearly all students in the course, before and since 2020, have gained their first significant introduction to disease models within this course. Examples of outbreaks we study include measles, Ebola, mumps, and whooping cough. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The approach used throughout this text is to dive into using, then building, disease models. We play with models and discover the ways each model responds to small and large changes. We represent the ideas of models using images, equations, words, graphs, and numbers. Each section centers on one or more activities, and as we work through these activities, we build up knowledge about how to construct and work with mathematical models of disease outbreaks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Who is the expected audience for this book?</em> The audience I have in mind while writing is a class of undergraduates, studying together, and checking in with their professor along the way. These students have studied at least one semester of calculus, focusing primarily on derivatives as rates of change. It helps for students to also recognize that integrals and derivatives are inverse operations, to know that integrals sum up area under a curve (when all values on the curve are nonnegative), and to be familiar with the idea of computing derivative and antiderivative formulas. Some sections of this text use linear algebra, specifically matrices and eigenvalues. These sections are not required for learning from this book. Or, for students who would like to include these sections but have not studied linear algebra, there is a brief tutorial available.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though undergraduates are the audience I primarily think about while writing, they are not the only audience. My goal is that anyone with some calculus background will be able to learn about mathematical epidemiology by working through these activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Who can teach from this book?</em> My goal is for many teachers and professors of college-level mathematics to feel comfortable teaching from this book. There is no requirement to have taught mathematical modeling before, or to have studied mathematical epidemiology. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>What other kinds of math will we use, besides calculus?</em> To do mathematical modeling, we use any math we need.  We typically jump into activities and then introduce new mathematical ideas whenever they are helpful. These math ideas come from differential equations, multivariable calculus, linear algebra, numerical analysis, probability, proofs, and more. If you have already studied some of these subjects, you may be able to move more quickly through some of the activities. On the other hand, if you have not yet taken full courses in these subjects, then there will be enough information contained here for you to learn what you need and keep modeling. And, perhaps, you may find that you want to learn more, and that may lead you to study additional areas of mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>What kind(s) of models will we use?</em> For most of this textbook, we use compartmental models, which can be drawn in pictures and written as ordinary differential equations. (It is OK to not know some of the terms in the previous sentence when you start: all will be explained.) Some of these models are called SIR models. We will mention other types of models, but we restrict our focus to compartmental models using ordinary differential equations so that we can fully understand the underlying math ideas, how to use the models, and how to visualize our results.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Do all the models in this text focus only on diseases?</em> Actually, no. The style of modeling we focus on has many other applications. We will investigate several other ways to use these models, including studying the spread of rumors, political party affiliations, and viral YouTube videos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for reading this introduction, and I hope you enjoy the book!

        <title>To Students: How to Get the Most from This Text</title>
        
        <p>
          Dear students working from this text: I hope you enjoy and learn a lot from these pages! My plan when writing has been to encourage active learning. This means that written explanations are kept to a minimum, and there are lots of chances for you to try things on your own or with other students. The book is filled with applications to real outbreaks; examples inspired by outbreaks; and applications to ideas that do not involve epidemics at all, but that can be represented by similar mathematics as what we use to study diseases. The types of mathematical models studied in this text are used currently in the world, by people making decisions about public policy and for other wide-reaching goals, and I want you to emerge from using this text with a strong sense of what these models can, and cannot, tell us.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chapters in this text are typically structured in a consistent way.     
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The <em>Goals</em> of the chapter appear at the very start.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              After a brief introduction, an <em>Exploration</em> activity asks you to engage with questions that motivate the rest of the chapter.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The sections within the chapter include some reading for you to do, and <em>Activities</em> appear frequently. It is best if you do these activities when they appear: many activities contain new information, rather than just examples, and later reading will assume you have already completed the activities. Some activities include hints or answers, and you will learn the most by completing as much of the activity as you can before checking the hints or reading the answers.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              At the end of each chapter, there are questions <em>For Further Thought</em> that provide deeper insights or additional examples of the chapter's ideas.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The <xref ref="glossary-of-terms"/> near the end of the book includes descriptions of key terms, along with the chapter in which each term first appears.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are footnotes in this book, appearing as a raised number.<fn>Here is an example of a footnote!</fn> In the web version of the book, clicking on the raised number shows the footnote in a box that opens below the paragraph. The web version of the book also contains live links. Some of the links, such as to chapters, take you to different pages of the book. Other links, such as to figures or equations that we saw earlier in the text, open a box showing these figures or equations directly where you are reading, so that you can see them without jumping from webpage to webpage. You will also see Python code boxes in this text, with a button after that says <c>Evaluate (Sage)</c>. In the web version of this text, you can click on the <c>Evaluate (Sage)</c> button to evaluate the code directly within the book.  
        </p>
        <p>
          For readers using an electronic PDF of this book, many things are similar to the web version, but the live links to equations and figures will lead to the original location of those items within the text, rather than opening them within a box within the page you are reading. 
        </p>
        <p>          
          For anyone not using the web version of this text, the Python code will not run directly, which requires you to set up some way to run Python on your computer. There are many ways to do this. Suggestions include (and are not limited to): copying the code directly into the box at the top of the page at <url href="https://sagecell.sagemath.org/">sagecell.sagemath.org</url>, using Google Colab at <url href="https://colab.research.google.com/">colab.research.google.com</url>, or downloading an installation of Python directly from <url href="https://www.python.org/">python.org</url>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last but not least: I will not tell you how to think. Mathematical modeling involves setting priorities and incorporating personal values, and each person gets to decide these for themselves.  This book focuses on the processes of developing and describing models, stating and supporting your assumptions, and understanding and explaining your model's outcomes. The mathematics certainly needs to be correct, and all the processes should be done carefully, but priorities and values are personal.
        </p>

          Thank you for reading!

        <title>Possible Discussion Themes</title>
        
        <p>
          <xref ref="expl-reading-about-disease-in-the-news-and-popular-media" /> is very open-ended. The goal of this exploration is to begin discussing outbreaks as they appear in news and popular culture writing. There is no hidden <q>right answer</q> to find.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many possible themes that may arise during discussion. Below, you can find a sample of such themes. These may help to expand thoughts and discussions you are already having about the articles. Or it is possible that you discovered yet other themes, beyond those listed here, and this is wonderful!
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Theme 1.</em> The diseases in the articles are measles and RSV. Both are highly contagious and spread through coughing and sneezing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Theme 2.</em> The articles give different kinds of information about the ways measles and RSV can spread. Some of the articles give descriptions that let us estimate incubation period or length of sickness, and some give fewer such descriptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Theme 3.</em> Some of the articles describe disease presence in the U.S. only, and some articles describe disease presence in other countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Theme 4.</em> All of the articles discuss vaccination, but there is not yet a vaccine for RSV. Some alternate control measures, such as hand washing or sanitizing surfaces, appear in one or more articles.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Theme 5.</em> The question about mathematical concepts could mean many things. There are many possible answers, including but not limited to: numbers of recent cases, lengths of time of the stages of disease, historical data about when more or fewer people have been ill in past years, or percentages of people vaccinated.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="sec-Follow-Up-By-Seeking-More-Precise-Data">
        <title>Follow Up By Seeking More Precise Data</title>
        <p>
          For these and other diseases or outbreaks we may read about, we can add to our knowledge of underlying disease biology by gathering additional data. We will find, when modeling diseases, that it can help to know the lengths of time for each disease stage, such as incubation period, how long a person is typically sick, and how long any immunity to the disease lasts. Vaccine data is also helpful, including whether a vaccine exists at all, how effective the vaccine is on average, and what percentage of people are vaccinated against a particular disease. Some of the data we collect may depend on time or place: vaccines may be newer, or different percentages of people may be vaccinated in different locations. 
        </p>
        <p>
          One place to look up data is the <url href="https://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</url>. As one example, a web search can take us to the <url href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.html">CDC's information page about measles</url>. Not every disease is presented in an identical manner on the CDC's web pages, but very commonly, there is a link for Transmission and another link for Signs and Symptoms. These typically contain lots of information about how diseases spread and how long each stage takes. Such information helps us build our models.
        </p>
        <activity>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Take a look at the <url href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/transmission.html">Transmission</url> and <url href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/symptoms/signs-symptoms.html">Signs and Symptoms</url> pages for measles at the CDC. Putting together the information on these pages, construct a timeline of measles contagion in a single person, starting at the time the person is first infected. Include the following, and include whatever other information appears important.
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    How long does it typically take for a person to begin being contagious?
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    How long is the total time period from when a person begins being contagious to when they no longer are contagious?
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    How does contagion overlap, or not overlap, with when a person has the typical measles rash?
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
                It is likely, for most diseases, that these timelines will involve ranges of time such as <q>3 to 5 days</q> rather than more specific amounts of time such as <q>4 days</q>. Time ranges will be helpful to us as we fine-tune our models.
            </p>

        First things first: let's simulate an outbreak! The simulations in this text, starting with <xref ref="expl-activity-zombie-game"/>, are directly inspired by the Disease Lab materials published freely online by Utah State University.<fn>Jim Powell and Matt Lewis, <q>Disease Lab</q> (2016). <em>Laboratory Experiences in Mathematical Biology</em>. 1.
        <url href="https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/lemb/1">https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/lemb/1</url></fn> You can do this exploration in a group or on your own. (Groups are recommended, if you are able to team up with one or more other people.) You will model humans, also called Susceptibles, as well as zombies, also called Infectious. The <url href="https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/lemb/1">Utah State University link</url> describes a hands-on way to play this game using dry erase markers and overhead projector transparencies. In this text, we primarily use a related online <url href="https://nelsong1997.github.io/zombie_game/">Zombie Game App</url><fn>This app was created by Gabe Nelson, Bates College Class of 2020, after campus closed due to COVID-19.</fn> to play and to generate data.

        Why do we start with a simulation? First, this course requires active involvement, so we create space immediately for that involvement. Second, this simulation game can be interactive, and working with others helps us see other perspectives and adds both fun and community to learning. Third, though we mostly work with real-life outbreaks in this textbook, we also purposely diverge from reality to think through hypothetical outcomes, and zombies are one way to think creatively about disease spread. Fourth, this activity generates outbreak examples, and examples throughout this course are one of our main ways to build toward theory and illustrate abstract concepts. Therefore, to achieve the goals for each section, we usually begin with exploration activities, then use what we learned in the explorations to help build our mathematical framework.

        <introduction>
          <p>
            This game uses a grid of 100 hexagons to represent a space in which humans and zombies interact. Each round of game play represents one day. For each day, each human (<q>Susceptible</q>) is represented on the grid by a blue <q>X</q> on a single hexagon. Each zombie (<q>Infectious</q>) is represented by three red dots connected by red lines, meant to suggest a head and two arms, each of which can infect a human. Each zombie spreads out across three connected hexagons. Sample hex grids, both unmarked and marked, appear in <xref ref="zombie-board-graphics" />.

Both a table of data, and a graph of Round 0 and Round 1 data, appear to the right.

              If you began with 49 humans and 1 zombie, these will be the numbers listed for Round 0. The data for Round 1 are computed by looking at the hex grid: each human that overlaps with a zombie is a <q>New Infection</q> and moves from the <em># Humans</em> category to the <em># Zombies</em> category. This means that this number of individuals is subtracted from <em># Humans</em> and added to <em># Zombies</em>. Double check that your count of new infections matches the app's count! In <xref ref="fig-zombie-app-one-day" />, the one zombie overlaps two blue X hexes. We therefore see that on Round 1 there are two <em>New Infections</em>. We also compare Round 1 with Round 0. The two <em>New Infections</em> for Round 1 mean that the population of <q>Susceptibles</q> (that is, humans) drops by 2, from 49 to 47, while the population of <q>Infectious</q> (that is, zombies) rises by 2, from 1 to 3.)

Continue to click <c>next round</c> at your own pace, thinking through the grid, table, and graph as each step proceeds. The game ends when there are either no humans left to infect, or no zombies left to keep infecting new humans.

              As an alternative to make the game more interactive, the app allows you to choose your own locations for humans and zombies. To choose your own locations, under <em>Mode</em>, check <em>Hotseat</em> instead of <em>Auto</em>. The app then prompts you to place all the Humans for one round of the simulation. After all Humans are placed, the app prompts you to place your Zombies. For each Zombie, you must place the head and the arms. When this is complete, the app shows both Humans and Zombies, to indicate how many new infections have occurred. To make this into a game, two people can play. One person places the Humans, <em>without their partner watching</em>. Then the partner places the Zombies, again <em>without their partner watching</em>. Then, together, the partners can see how many new infections there are, once the Human and Zombie grids are shown together. Is there any strategy that helps either the Humans or the Zombies?

                  So far, we have mostly kept the default settings in the app, and played just one version of the hands-on game, but what if we changed the rules for human<ndash />zombie interaction?

          In this book, we work with mathematical models. As a first step toward building mathematical models, we should think through the underlying <q>rules</q> of our situation. We should also think through any outcomes of these rules. Must these rules always lead to similar outcomes? Could these same rules produce significantly different outcomes? Spending time on understanding our system is a crucial part of making sure our mathematical approaches make sense.

          There are many other things you may notice. To name just a few ideas: you may think about the speed with which each curve rises or falls. You may think about how much these speeds change when you try the game several times. You may relate a rise in one graph to a fall in the other, thinking about a sort of symmetry between the two graphs. You may think about when the rising or falling is relatively slow vs. relatively fast. These and many other observations are a valued and central part of working toward mathematical model building.

          After completing a simulation, you have data for the numbers of humans and zombies during each day of the outbreak. These data can be presented as a table of values, and they can be presented as a graph. In the app, the table format for data appears as in <xref ref="fig-human-zombie-data-table" />, and the graph format for data appears as in <xref ref="fig-human-zombie-data-graph" />.

          As we build a model, we focus on the relatively slow changes in population sizes that happen near the beginning and end of the model. This may not happen in every simulation: for instance, sometimes zombies happen to infect a lot of humans in the last time step. However, in other simulations, one lone human may last for many days before being infected. We focus on what happens <em>on average</em>. For this model, on average, the pace of infection seems slower near the beginning and near the end of the outbreak.
        </p>
        <activity>
          <statement>
            <p>
              One observation is that the pace of infection is slower when there are relatively few humans, or when there are relatively few zombies.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Can you see why it makes sense that infection tends to spread less quickly when there are fewer individuals in one of the populations?
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Conversely, why does it make sense for infection to spread relatively rapidly when there are relatively large numbers of both humans and zombies?
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  To take the discussion about pace of infection to a logical extreme: how fast can infection spread when there are zero humans, or when there are zero zombies?
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </statement>
        </activity>
        <p>
          Putting this all together, we can say that, on average, the change in the number of infections seems to depend on both the number of humans (Susceptibles) and the number of zombies (Infectious). One mathematical approach to writing this is to say that new cases per day are proportional to the number of Susceptibles multiplied by the number of Infectious. We can write this as follows:
        </p>

        <mdn>
          <mrow xml:id="eq-proportionality">( \# \mbox{ New Infections}) \amp \propto (\# \mbox{ Susceptibles}) \cdot (\# \mbox{ Infectious}) </mrow>
        </mdn>

        <p>
          To turn this into a mathematical formula, we will use a <em>system of ordinary differential equations</em>. This is a good time to mention: to read and learn from this text, there is no need to have taken a course on differential equations. To write and work with the models we use, it is sufficient to know these ideas from calculus:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              derivatives represent change;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              an increasing graph has a positive slope and a derivative greater than zero;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              a decreasing graph has a negative slope and a derivative less than zero; and
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              a horizontal graph (one in which the output value is not changing) has a slope of zero and a derivative equal to zero.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          One other helpful piece of information is the fact that a differential equation is just an equation containing a derivative. Many of the equations in calculus contain a derivative. A quick example is <m>f'(x)=3x+2</m>, which contains the derivative <m>f'(x)</m>. This means that if you have studied calculus, then you have already built significant experience using differential equations.
        </p>
        <p>
          With these calculus ideas in mind, we return to our model. We will write two equations, one to represent the change in the Susceptible population and one to represent the change in the Infectious population. When we say <q>change</q>, we mean the change that happens on average if we were to run the simulation many times. Our independent variable is time, which we label <m>t</m>. You may have noticed that time is the variable on the horizontal axis: this axis is labeled <q>Round</q> in the app, and it represents time in the form of days. For our dependent variables, we choose letters that correspond to the names of each population. This makes the dependent variable meanings easier to remember, and for many people, it makes the differential equations easier to interpret. Therefore let <m>S = S(t)</m> represent the Susceptible population and <m>I = I(t)</m> represent the Infectious population. Since our populations are represented by the letters <m>S</m> and <m>I</m>, we call this model an <term>SI model</term>. We say the names of each of the first two letters when saying <q>SI model</q> aloud, that is, we say <q>S</q> <q>I</q> <q>model</q>.

          You may have noticed that our data show us not just total numbers of <m>S(t)</m> and <m>I(t)</m> at each time step, but also show how <m>S(t)</m> and <m>I(t)</m> change over time. The number of New Infections tells us precisely how many people change, on each day, from the <m>S(t)</m> population to the <m>I(t)</m> population. We now connect <m>S(t)</m>, <m>I(t)</m>, and the number of New Infections using differential equations and the proportionality relationship from <xref ref="eq-proportionality" />:

          There is a lot of calculus happening in these SI model equations! Here are some of the key ideas to notice.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The derivative term <m>dS/dt</m> represents the change, across time, in population <m>S(t)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Similarly, the derivative <m>dI/dt</m> represents the change, across time, in population <m>I(t)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In this model, individuals leaving <m>S(t)</m> go immediately into <m>I(t)</m>, which is why the same term <m>\beta S I</m> appears on the right-hand side of both equations.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Individuals can only leave <m>S(t)</m>, so <m>S(t)</m> decreases, and <m>dS/dt</m> is negative. We actually see the negative sign (<m>-</m>) written into the differential equation.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Individuals can only enter <m>I(t)</m>, so <m>I(t)</m> increases, and <m>dI/dt</m> is positive. We do not explicitly write a positive sign (<m>+</m>), but we note that there is no negative sign (<m>-</m>).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The values of <m>S(t)</m> and <m>I(t)</m> should never be negative. They should be either positive or zero. This makes sense because they represent populations of individuals. This must also be true mathematically, in order for the model to make sense.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We represent the idea of proportionality by using the parameter <m>\beta</m>. We will experiment in <xref ref="ch-visualization-graphing-model-results-and-data" /> with different values of <m>\beta</m> to see how changing <m>\beta</m> affects the outcomes of the model.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The value of <m>\beta</m> must be positive. This observation is consistent with us directly seeing the negative sign (<m>-</m>) when a term is negative, and not seeing the negative sign when a term is positive. (With this observation, it could be possible for <m>\beta</m> to be 0, but if there is any outbreak and any interaction of <m>S(t)</m> with <m>I(t)</m>, then <m>\beta</m> will not be 0.)
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This model uses differential equations, which think of time as continuous, using every real value for <m>t</m> starting at <m>t=0</m>. By contrast, when we collect data from the zombie game, time is <term>discrete</term>, meaning that time steps forward through values such as <q>Day 0</q>, <q>Day 1</q>, <q>Day 2</q>, and so on. In this course, we mainly use differential equation models, meaning time is thought of as <term>continuous</term>. Continuous time may match well with our intuitive sense of how time works: time does not stop and start. However, the data we collect about disease spread will often be discrete, on time scales such as days or weeks. We will include this knowledge in our work with models.

          In <xref ref="ch-zombies-can-math-help" /> we simulated a simple outbreak. This outbreak can be modeled using the <em>system of ordinary differential equations</em> appearing in <xref ref="eq-S-in-SImodel" /> and <xref ref="eq-I-in-SImodel" />. Here is the system, also called an SI model, again:

        <p>
          We began to explore the differences between the discrete data, collected round-by-round in the Zombie Game App, and the continuous model, which uses a system of differential equations to produce smooth curves. In this chapter, we continue that exploration visually, by producing graphs of data and graphs of model results. We also see a first, very visual, way to estimate the value of <m>\beta</m> in our model. (There will be other, more detailed, ways to estimate <m>\beta</m>, as we continue in this text.) To do all this, we employ visualization tools. This text uses cells that run both Python and <url href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</url>, which <q>is a free open-source mathematics software system</q><fn><url href="https://www.sagemath.org/">https://www.sagemath.org/</url></fn>, for visualization. The Python code here can be used in any setting where you use Python.<fn>The Python-related goal of this text is to make it as easy and intuitive as possible for readers to jump into using Python, so that we can better explore disease models. Some readers may prefer different Python syntax, or using a different program altogether, and these alternate approaches are welcome.</fn>

            If you have never used Python before, you are in the right place! If you have used Python, you may be able to move through this chapter more quickly, but be sure to spend time to make sure you know the code you need to complete modeling tasks. In this chapter, we spend a significant amount of time reading code, viewing code output, and making changes to code, to build up enough Python knowledge to be able to generate additional graphs of data and model results. The code we practice with allows us to visualize the sample data set shown as a table in <xref ref="fig-human-zombie-data-table"/>.

One way to do this quickly is to go to <url href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html">this page about colors</url> from the online documentation for <c>matplotlib</c>, and scroll down to the header <q>CSS Colors</q>. Replace <q>blue</q> and <q>orange</q> with colors you choose from the CSS Colors list, and view the resulting graph. (There are many other ways to choose colors in Python, and you can search online examples and documentation to learn about these.)

            The first two lines of the Python code are important, but their phrasing does not make very obvious what they do. Line 1 imports a Python package that includes commands for drawing plots. Line 2 clears any past plots, meaning any past plots should be completely gone. This makes sure that any new plot contains only what we want. Line 2 may not be needed when we very first use Python, but if we create a different plot, and then come back to this code cell and re-enter it, the other plot we created could be overlaid with this one. The <q>clear</q> command, <c>plt.cla()</c>, makes sure that only our current plot appears.

        <title><q>Solving</q> Differential Equations Using Graphs</title>

        <p>
          Our goal in this section is to learn to use Python to create graphs similar to what we saw in <xref ref="fig-first-si-graph"/>. Such a graph starts with a system of differential equations and draws one possible <term>graphical solution</term> to that system. The graphical solution drawn depends on the equations themselves, the value(s) of any parameter(s), and the starting values for each population in the system, that is, the values when <m>t=0</m> of <m>S(t)</m>, <m>I(t)</m>, and any other populations being modeled. For now, we specify that this type of solution is a <em>graphical solution</em>, but as the book continues, we will often refer to a graphical solution as simply a <em>solution</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          One thing we will <em>almost never</em> do is solve an entire system of differential equations in the way you may have seen in a calculus course, where we wrote the solution as a formula. To remind you how this often looks in calculus class<mdash/>that is, how it looks to solve by writing the solution of a differential equation as a formula<mdash/>we show an example in <xref ref="exer-solve-de"/>. Then <xref ref="exer-cannot-easily-solve-de-system"/> begins the discussion about why we use a different approach in this text.

              As we mentioned back in <xref ref="ch-zombies-can-math-help"/>, a differential equation is just an equation in which at least one term is a derivative. This means that an equation like <m>dy/dt=\cos t + 3</m> is a differential equation. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Solving a differential equation often means finding a way to write an equivalent relationship, without including a derivative. Using this interpretation of <q>solving</q>: solve

              The general solution is <m>y=\sin t + 3t + C</m>, where <m>C</m> can be any constant. In this case, we solved by computing the antiderivatives of both sides of the differential equation.

              What are the challenges to solving this system of equations, where <q>solving</q> means determining formulas that do not involve derivatives for <m>S(t)</m> and <m>I(t)</m>? 
            </p>
             
          </statement>
          <hint>
            <p>
              There are many ways to answer this. One consideration is that each of the differential equations involves both <m>S</m> and <m>I</m>. This means the differential equations do not stand alone: each depends on the other. This interrelationship means we cannot just compute two separate antiderivative formulas. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Another consideration is that the right-hand side of the differential equation in <xref ref="exer-solve-de"/> involves only <m>t</m>, that is, only the independent variable. The dependent variable <m>y</m> does not appear except in the derivative term <m>dy/dt</m>. However, in the SI model system of equations, the dependent variables <m>S</m> and <m>I</m> appear in the derivatives <em>and elsewhere in the equations</em>. The antiderivative methods learned in a typical introductory Calculus course do not apply in this situation.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may have thought of yet other challenges as well.

        <p>
          As discussed in <xref ref="exer-cannot-easily-solve-de-system"/>, solving a system of differential equations is challenging. As we include more than two compartments, finding solution formulas for <m>S(t)</m>, <m>I(t)</m>, and additional populations becomes yet more challenging, and is often impossible. Even when we can determine solution formulas, they are typically quite complicated to work with.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, our approach is to compute <term>numerical solutions</term>, which are solutions in the form of numbers. 
          <!-- More mathematical details appear in <xref ref="ch-numerical-simulations-an-overview-of-how-computers-turn-equations-into-graphs"/>, but  -->
          The main idea is that Python starts at the initial population values, then uses the system of differential equations to <q>step through</q> the full range of time, computing population values step-by-step at later times by using information about how the population values change throughout. The system of differential equations is made up of derivatives, which are rates of change, so they exactly describe how the populations change at all times <m>t</m>. The population values computed in the numerical solution can be printed, or more often, graphed, to see the results in the form of a graphical solution.
        </p>

        <p>
          We noted earlier that graphical solutions may be called simply <em>solutions</em>. Similarly, numerical solutions are sometimes called simply <em>solutions</em>. And we have seen that formula-based solutions can be called simply <em>solutions</em>. It is important to use context to determine which kind of solution is being discussed, in this text or in other reading.

                  The formulas for the system of differential equations appear most directly in line 8, in order. The first formula is <c>-beta * S * I</c>, and the second formula is <c>beta * S * I</c>. Collectively, these are labeled <c>dy/dt</c>. More generally, the lines 6<ndash/>9 define the system of differential equations.

The initial conditions appear in square brackets and are separated by a comma. This syntax should look familiar from line 8, when we entered the right-hand sides of the differential equations all in one command, using the same syntax.

            <cline>     from scipy.integrate import odeint</cline>
          </cd>
          we import online packages that make it possible for Python to do some of the things we are about to do. Saying we are importing <q>as</q> gives us a name, such as <c>plt</c> or <c>np</c>, by which to call each package and use the tools within that package.
        </p>

          The lines

            <cline>       S, I = y</cline>

            <cline>       return dydt</cline>
          </cd>
          define the system of differential equations, using the command <c>def</c>. The system is named <c>hz</c>, for <q>human-zombie</q>, and the <c>(y, t)</c> means that the model depends on variables <m>y</m> and <m>t</m>. The line <c>S, I = y</c> defines <m>y</m> as comprising both <m>S</m> and <m>I</m>, in that order. This means that <m>y</m> collectively represents all our dependent variables. Taking the derivative of <m>y</m>, then, means taking each of the derivatives <m>dS/dt</m> and <m>dI/dt</m>. The formulas for these derivatives, which are on the right-hand sides of the SI model, appear in order in the line <c>dydt = [-beta * S * I, beta * S * I]</c>. Finally, the line <c>return dydt</c> ends the definition and says that whenever we later use the definition, we will be using the derivatives defined in <c>dydt</c>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A quick way to think about these lines is that they define our system of differential equations and label them as <c>hz</c>.

          The lines 
          <cd>

          </cd>
          provide values for <m>\beta</m>, the initial conditions <m>S(0)</m> and <m>I(0)</m>, and <m>t</m>. Any of these values can be changed, and the code can be run again, to produce a different numerical simulation of the same system of differential equations. Notice that the initial conditions are listed in the same order as how we defined the differential equations: <m>S(0)=49</m> is first, and <m>I(0)=1</m> is second.

          The solution of the system of differential equations 
          <cd>

          </cd>
          is a numerical solution, and it includes multiple parts. The solution is named <c>sol</c>. The Python command <c>odeint</c> computes the solution. For <c>odeint</c> to run, it needs three things: (1) a system of differential equations <c>hz</c>, (2) initial conditions <c>y0</c> for the differential equations, and (3) a time range <c>t_range</c> across which to create the solution. Though <c>odeint</c> computes the numerical solution, it does not show us the graphical solution: the plots we create later show us these results. Instead, the numerical solution created by <c>odeint</c> consists of lists of numbers for <m>S</m> and for <m>I</m>, at the times specified in <c>t_range</c>. (If you would like to see the numerical values computed by <c>sol</c>, include the line <c>print(sol)</c> in the block of Python code above, sometime after the line <c>sol = odeint(hz, y0, t_range)</c>. When you then evaluate the code, the list of values will appear.)

            <cline>     plt.plot(t_range, sol[:, 1], color='orange')</cline>
          </cd>
          create, but do not show, the plots of graphical solutions to the system of differential equations. For each plot, we provide the input values <c>t_range</c> and the output values from the numerical solution <c>sol</c>. As described above, <c>sol</c> is a set of numbers which are the values of the populations <m>S(t)</m> and <m>I(t)</m> at all the times in <c>t_range</c>. The numbers in <c>sol</c> are structured into two lists, list 0 and list 1. (Python often counts things, such as lists, starting with 0 rather than starting with 1.) The syntax <c>sol[:,0]</c> describes all the <m>S(t)</m> data. The colon <c>:</c> means <q>all</q> the elements, and the <c>0</c> means list 0, which is the list containing values of <m>S(t)</m>. The syntax <c>sol[:,1]</c> describes all the <m>I(t)</m> data, with <c>:</c> again representing <q>all</q> and <c>1</c> representing list 1, which contains <m>I(t)</m> values.

          The lines above include colors for each graph, <c>'blue'</c> for the <m>S(t)</m> graph and <c>'orange'</c> for the <m>I(t)</m> graph. Stating colors is optional.

          These are all the basics for numerically solving a system of differential equations. In <xref ref="sec-estimating-beta-and-building-visualization-skills"/> we create a graph in which data points and solution curves appear all on the same set of axes. Combining these plots provides a visual way to change the value of <m>\beta</m> to improve the model's fit to data points. Then, also in <xref ref="sec-estimating-beta-and-building-visualization-skills"/>, we discuss helpful ways to visualize information on graphs, so readers can best understand the results that emerge from models.

            There are many possible answers regarding the value of <m>\beta</m>. The key is to discuss what a good fit may look like. When the data and model do not fit perfectly, which is usually what will happen, then which aspects of the data do we most hope are represented in the model's solution curves?

          At this point, you have worked with enough Python code to be able to graph your own data points and your own solutions to systems of differential equations that represent disease spread. Before we complete this chapter, however, we spend additional time with Python and visualization, with the goal of designing plots that best convey the information learned from models.

          <em>Comments</em> are mentioned in <xref ref="exer-grid-axis-labels-comments"/>. In Python, comments are helpful for turning code lines on and off. One reason to do this is to troubleshoot: if code seems to not be working, turning some lines temporarily into comments can help narrow down where the problem lies. Another reason to include comments is to write notes about what is happening in the code. This is helpful if you will use this code later, or share it with other people, to make it easier for you and others to use the code in the future.
        </p>

        In <xref ref="ch-zombies-can-math-help" /> we simulated a simple outbreak. This outbreak can be modeled using the <em>system of ordinary differential equations</em> appearing in <xref ref="eq-S-in-SImodel" /> and <xref ref="eq-I-in-SImodel" />. Here is the system again:

      <p>
        This style of model is called a <term>compartmental model</term> because the individuals in our model are designated by categories called <term>compartments</term>; in this case, the compartments are <q>Susceptibles</q> and <q>Infectious</q>. In <xref ref="ch-zombies-can-math-help" /> we made calculus-based observations of the differential equations in this model.

        In this text, we regularly represent the dynamics of an outbreak using both compartmental model drawings and systems of differential equations. When we are careful in how we draw our compartmental diagrams, we can use these diagrams interchangeably with their corresponding systems of differential equations. In this chapter, we learn the vocabulary of compartmental models, as well as ways to draw compartmental diagrams so they clearly and completely represent the information contained in their corresponding systems of differential equations.

      <p>
        We begin in <xref ref="expl-activity-varying-the-human-zombie-game"/> by trying a different version of the human<ndash/>zombie game. We then ask you to use the intuition you are building to think through how the compartmental diagram should look for this human<ndash/>zombie game variation. After that, we discuss more details about compartmental diagrams. <em>You are strongly encouraged to try to build your own compartmental diagram before moving on to the text's discussion of the details.</em>

        <title>Varying the Human<ndash />Zombie Game</title>
        <introduction>
          <p>
            In the original <url href="https://nelsong1997.github.io/zombie_game/">Zombie Game App</url>, once an individual becomes a zombie, they are always a zombie. This means that no one leaves the Infectious compartment. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Suppose, instead, that zombies do not last forever. Instead, after some number of days, the zombies die (again), or in other words, the zombies become inactive. The number of days they remain Infectious before becoming inactive can be stated in the app.
          </p>
        </introduction>
        
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              <em>Before trying this scenario in the app</em>, think through how zombie death, and different zombie lifespans, would change the outcomes of the simulation. In particular, think carefully about these questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  What do you <em>expect</em> will happen if Zombies die, that is, they become inactive and unable to spread infection? Whether you feel very certain, or somewhat uncertain, articulate some outcomes that you think will occur with this game variation.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  How might your expected outcomes differ from those in the original model?
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Outcomes might be measured by the table of data, by the graphs, by the timing of how infection spreads, by the numbers of survivors, or in other ways. For each of your expectations about how the outcomes may change, what support can you show for why this expectation makes sense?
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This exercise is not about right or wrong ideas, but instead is about building hypotheses, comparing the hypotheses with data, and developing deeper understanding of what the model shows.

      <section xml:id="sec-compartmental-diagrams-vocabulary-and-comments">
        <title>Compartmental Diagrams: Vocabulary and Comments</title>

        <p>
          In this section, we give a general description of compartmental diagrams. As you read, check in with the intuition you have been building: do these ideas fit with your understanding so far? Soon, in <xref ref="sec-from-zombie-game-variation-to-compartmental-diagram"/>, we will connect these general ideas about compartmental diagrams with the specific model you constructed in <xref ref="expl-activity-varying-the-human-zombie-game"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A compartmental diagram is made up of boxes and arrows, each labeled to show what it represents. The boxes are called <term>compartments</term> and represent mutually distinct groups of individuals. The arrows indicate the possible ways that individuals can relocate from one compartment to another.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we say <q>mutually distinct</q>, we mean that at any moment in time, an individual is in exactly one compartment: no more, no fewer. This means our entire population is fully accounted for at all times because everyone appears in some compartment. We also notice that we cannot double-count individuals, as they cannot be in more than one compartment at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because our models use continuous time and differential equations, we will sometimes compute non-integer values for the number of individuals in some compartments. We should think through this carefully. If, for instance, we find that at some time we have 13.6 Susceptibles and 36.4 Infectious, we are not saying that we have 13 Susceptibles, plus 36 Infectious, plus one individual who is split up to be 60% Susceptible and 40% Infectious. Instead, the differential equation model is telling us on average what happens, across many possible simulations or many possible outcomes. In computing an <em>on average</em> outcome, non-integer values are possible. If we wish to refer to actual numbers of people, we can round to the nearest integer, or use language that reflects the <em>on average</em> meaning of our model.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we use a compartmental diagram, we should carefully define and describe all our terms. The definitions and descriptions may change in different models, so we should not assume that <m>t</m>, <m>S</m>, <m>I</m>, or other variables always have the same meaning. Time, <m>t</m>, may be measured in days, weeks, or some other unit, and we should indicate the unit. Here are possible descriptions for <m>S</m> and <m>I</m> based on the human<ndash />zombie game in <xref ref="ch-zombies-can-math-help" />: <m>S</m> stands for the Susceptible population, meaning people who do not have the zombie disease yet but could become ill with this disease, and <m>I</m> stands for the Infectious population, meaning individuals who are currently contagious and currently showing symptoms of the zombie disease. In other outbreaks, and therefore in other models, these descriptions may change. As just one example, <m>I</m> in a different model may refer to individuals who are Infectious in the sense that they are contagious, but they may or may not be showing symptoms. Modelers should fully state the specific definitions of <m>S</m>, <m>I</m>, or other populations, in their models. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The term <m>\beta SI</m> indicates flow from <m>S</m> to <m>I</m>. This term indicates that the flow depends on both the population <m>S</m> and the population <m>I</m>. When either population is very small, flow is relatively small. When both populations are relatively large, their product is large and therefore flow is relatively large. This sort of term is called a <em>mass action</em> term, from the Law of Mass Action in chemistry. The idea of mass action is just one way to model flow from one compartment to another; we will study other formulas for flow.
        </p>

        <p>
          The letters <m>S</m>, <m>I</m>, and <m>t</m> are variables in the model. The Greek letter <m>\beta</m> is a parameter. We use the following conventions for letters in most of the models we study: 
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Time is denoted as the <em>lowercase letter</em> <m>t</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We use <em>capital letters</em> such as <m>S</m> and <m>I</m> to indicate populations of people, which are typically functions of time, so that <m>S=S(t)</m>, <m>I=I(t)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Greek letters</em> such as <m>\beta</m> represent some aspect of how a disease progresses and are called <term>parameters</term>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
             A parameter may seem to behave a bit like a variable, since it can take on different values. However, parameters play a different role than variables in our models. In a given simulation, <em>we use biological information to set all parameter values</em>. By contrast, we choose only the initial values of our variables, that is, the values when <m>t=0</m>, and then the simulation reveals the values of each variable at later points in time. For instance, in the human<ndash />zombie example, we start at <m>t=0</m> with 49 humans and 1 zombie. Writing this in mathematical terms: <m>S(0)=49</m> and <m>I(0)=1</m>. After <m>t=0</m>, the populations of Susceptibles and Infectious depend on the outcome of the simulation. Even the length of time for the simulation depends on how long it takes the Infectious zombies to convert all the Susceptible humans.

        <title>From Zombie Game Variation to Compartmental Diagram</title>
        
        <p>
          The Zombie Game variation in <xref ref="expl-activity-varying-the-human-zombie-game" /> introduces a new category of individuals, beyond Susceptibles and Infectious. This new category corresponds to a new compartment, compared with <xref ref="fig-SI-compartmental-diagram" />, in the model's compartmental diagram. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When zombies die, they leave the Infectious compartment and can no longer infect the Susceptibles. It is typical to represent these dynamics by introducing a Removed (R) compartment for the individuals who were zombies but have then become inactive. Our model then includes S, I, and R compartments, so we call it an <term>SIR model</term>.<fn>We typically say each of the letters in SIR when naming this model aloud. That is, we refer to the <q>S</q> <q>I</q> <q>R</q> model, not the <q>sir</q> model.</fn>  A compartmental diagram representing the dynamics of this SIR model appears in <xref ref="fig-SIR-compartmental-diagram" />.

        In this diagram, we include the S and I compartments used previously, while also allowing the Infectious zombies to leave the I compartment and enter the R compartment, where they stay for the rest of the simulation. The mathematical formula for movement from I to R is <m>\gamma I</m>. The parameter <m>\gamma</m> (the Greek letter <em>gamma</em>) represents the rate at which individuals leave <m>I</m> and enter <m>R</m>. Larger values of <m>\gamma</m>, for instance, mean that zombies become inactive more rapidly than with smaller values of <m>\gamma</m>. This formula indicates that neither Susceptibles nor Removed individuals influence movement from I to R: instead, only the number of Infectious people, and a rate based on how long they remain zombies, determine this movement between compartments.

                It should be true that individuals are in exactly one compartment at a time, but with all claims such as this, you should convince yourself or else ask questions about it. It should also be true that individuals cannot progress in any order other than what the compartmental diagram shows. However, in some simulations, some individuals may not leave compartment S. By contrast, with <xref ref="expl-activity-zombie-game"/> and the SI model, all individuals progress from the S compartment to the I compartment.

A typical way to label this compartment is E, which stands for Exposed. (Notice that we already are using I for Infectious, so we cannot use I for Incubating.) The word Exposed may be misleading, since in daily life, we tend to think of being exposed to illness as meaning that a person may or may not become sick. Instead, in our model, the Exposed individuals will definitely become sick. For this reason, in this text, we will refer to the E compartment as <term>Exposed-and-incubating</term>. This model then includes the S, E, and I compartments, so we call it SEI. A compartmental diagram representing the dynamics of this simulation appears in <xref ref="fig-SEI-compartmental-diagram" />.

        <p>
          We begin to see in <xref ref="activity-understanding-gamma-pt2"/> that we can understand <m>\gamma</m> intuitively in relationship to how long an individual is in the I compartment. A compartmental model does not track individuals directly, and the responses in <xref ref="activity-understanding-gamma-pt2"/> do not suggest that every individual in an outbreak is sick for a precise amount of time that is shown by <m>\gamma</m>. Instead, the relationship between <m>\gamma</m> and length of time in compartment I shows how long <em>on average</em> individuals stay in compartment I. We can write this relationship mathematically:
        </p>
        <mdn>
          <mrow xml:id="eq-gamma-estimate">\frac{1}{\gamma} \amp \approx \mbox{average length of time an individual spends in compartment I.} </mrow>
        </mdn>
        <p>
          Another way to phrase this, when being in the I compartment corresponds to a person being infectious, is:
        </p>
        <mdn>
          <mrow xml:id="eq-gamma-estimate-2">\frac{1}{\gamma} \amp \approx \mbox{average length of time an individual is infectious.} </mrow>
        </mdn>
        <p>
          In <xref ref="exercises-ch-compartmental-diagrams"/> we use the ideas in <xref ref="eq-gamma-estimate"/> and <xref ref="eq-gamma-estimate-2"/> to estimate <m>\gamma</m> for specific outbreaks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that <m>1/\gamma</m> is an amount of time. This means that the units of <m>\gamma</m> are <m>1/\mbox{time}</m>. This observation corresponds with <m>\gamma</m> being a <term>rate</term>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many, but not all, of the parameters in the models in this text are rates. Usually, when a parameter in a compartmental model is a rate, we can estimate its value in a similar way to how we estimate <m>\gamma</m> in <xref ref="eq-gamma-estimate"/>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular, notice that <m>\beta</m> in our model can not be a rate. We see this when we recognize that each term in a model equation must have the same units: otherwise, we cannot set terms equal to each other, or add or subtract terms. Explore how this works in <xref ref="activity-introducing-units"/>.

            <p>
              Recall that each of the variables <m>S</m>, <m>I</m>, and <m>R</m> represents some average number of individuals. This means that the units for each of <m>S</m>, <m>I</m>, and <m>R</m> are <em>population</em>.<fn>Alternately, we could call these units <em>people</em> or <em>individuals</em>.</fn> We also just saw from the discussion of <xref ref="eq-gamma-estimate"/> that the units of <m>\gamma</m> are <m>1/\mbox{time}</m>.

                  Consider the equation <m>\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I</m> from the SIR model. What are the units of the term <m>\frac{dR}{dt}</m> on the left-hand side, and what are the units of the term <m>\gamma I</m> on the right-hand side? Can you confirm that these two terms have the same units?

              <li>
                <p>
                  Next, consider the equation <m>\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta S I - \gamma I</m> from the SIR model. Start by using the first part of this activity to determine the units of <m>\frac{dI}{dt}</m> and <m>\gamma I</m>. Next, in order for the units to be the same for all three terms, what should the units be for <m>\beta S I</m>?

                  Use your results from the first two parts of this activity to confirm that the units are the same on both sides of the equation <m>\frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta S I</m> in the SIR model.

                <p>
                  The term <m>\frac{dR}{dt}</m> has units <m>\mbox{(population)} / \mbox{(time)}</m> because the units of <m>R</m> in the numerator are <em>population</em> and the units of <m>t</m> in the denominator are <em>time</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The term <m>\gamma I</m> has units <m>\mbox{(population)} / \mbox{(time)}</m> because <m>\gamma</m> has units <m>1/\mbox{time}</m> and <m>I</m> has units (population).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Both sides have the same units, namely <m>\mbox{(population)} / \mbox{(time)}</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The terms <m>\frac{dI}{dt}</m> and <m>\gamma I</m> have units <m>\mbox{(population)} / \mbox{(time)}</m>, for similar reasons to those described in the first part of this activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The term <m>\beta S I</m> should therefore also have units <m>\mbox{(population)} / \mbox{(time)}</m>. Since there are two populations, <m>S</m> and <m>I</m>, multiplied in the numerator, this means that <m>\beta</m> must have units <m>1/(\mbox{population} \cdot \mbox{time})</m>.

              <li>
                <p>
                  The term <m>\frac{dS}{dt}</m> has units <m>\mbox{(population)} / \mbox{(time)}</m>, for similar reasons to those described in the first part of this activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Within the term <m>-\beta S I</m>, we saw in the second part of this activity that <m>\beta</m> has units <m>1/(\mbox{population} \cdot \mbox{time})</m>. Both <m>S</m> and <m>I</m> have units (population). Multiplying together the three terms <m>\beta</m>, <m>S</m>, and <m>I</m>, the resulting units are <m>\mbox{(population)} / \mbox{(time)}</m>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  These observations confirm that the units are the same on both sides of the equation <m>\frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta S I</m>.

          After completing <xref ref="activity-introducing-units"/>, we recognize that in our SIR model, the units of <m>\beta</m> are not <m>1/\mbox{time}</m>. Therefore <m>\beta</m> is not a rate, and we cannot estimate the value of <m>\beta</m> similarly to how we estimate the value of <m>\gamma</m>. Indeed, estimating the value of <m>\beta</m> will require different methods. In <xref ref="ch-visualization-graphing-model-results-and-data"/> we discuss estimating <m>\beta</m> visually by comparing our model with data. In <xref ref="ch-model-analysis-and-the-basic-reproduction-number-R0"/> and <xref ref="ch-vaccines-and-incubation-periods"/> we introduce another way to estimate <m>\beta</m>, using other parameter values we know, along with a formula involving an epidemiological concept known as the <term>basic reproduction number</term>.

          By now, we have studied models from several perspectives. In <xref ref="ch-zombies-can-math-help"/> and the Zombie Game App, we generated data for an outbreak, constructed tables and graphs of data, and thought through how all these pieces of information fit together. <xref ref="ch-zombies-can-math-help"/> then introduced using a system of differential equations for describing the relationships. The Python code in <xref ref="ch-visualization-graphing-model-results-and-data"/> generated images of data points and solution curves for systems of differential equations. Finally, and crucially, we began drawing compartmental diagrams in <xref ref="ch-compartmental-diagrams"/>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          These multiple forms of describing models all work together. They allow us to understand models and their results through graphs, equations, data, and diagrams. Now that we have these tools for discussing models, we take time to mathematically analyze models. Some of this analysis is necessary for confirming that our models make sense in relationship to the real world. Additional analysis of models gives us ways to think about controlling outbreaks.

        <title>Using Calculus to Analyze Models</title>

        <p>
          The work of <xref ref="expl-rise-and-fall-of-an-epidemic"/> involves central ideas from introductory calculus. The equations of the SIR model are <em>differential equations</em>, which means they include derivatives. Derivatives represent <em>change</em>, and we often describe this change as the <em>slope of a graph</em>. The graphs we use in studying models are the <em>solution curves</em> of the model. That is, given equations for, say, <m>dS/dt</m>, <m>dI/dt</m>, and <m>dR/dt</m>, the solution curves are the graphs of <m>S(t)</m>, <m>I(t)</m>, and <m>R(t)</m>, with time <m>t</m> on the horizontal axis, and the populations <m>S</m>, <m>I</m>, and <m>R</m> on the vertical axis.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let us continue with model analysis, specifically naming calculus concepts along the way.
        </p>
        <activity xml:id="activity-total-population">
          <statement>
            <p>
              Consider the SIR model:
            </p>
            <md>
              <mrow>\frac{dS}{dt} \amp = -\beta S I </mrow>
              <mrow>\frac{dI}{dt} \amp = \beta S I - \gamma I </mrow>
              <mrow>\frac{dR}{dt} \amp = \gamma I </mrow>
            </md>
            <p>
              and define <m>N(t)=S(t)+I(t)+R(t)</m> to be the <term>total population</term> being modeled, at time <m>t</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Each equation in this model represents the change in a single compartment's population, over time. How can we use the equations in the model to represent the <em>change in total population</em> over time? That is, how can we use the equations to represent <m>dN/dt</m>?
            </p>
            <p>
              Determine the value of the <em>change in total population</em>: you should be able to compute a number. What does this number tell us about the total population in our model? 
            </p>
          </statement>
          <hint>
            <p>
              Add together the three differential equations. What is the meaning of the left-hand side? What is the meaning of the right-hand side? And what value do we obtain on the right-hand side when summing the differential equations?
            </p>
          </hint>
          <answer>
            <p>
              On the left-hand side:
            </p>
            <md>
              <mrow>\frac{dS}{dt}+\frac{dI}{dt}+\frac{dR}{dt} \amp = \frac{d(S+I+R)}{dt} = \frac{dN}{dt}.</mrow>
            </md>
            <p>
              Therefore, summing the three differential equations determines the change over time of the total population.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the right-hand side:
            </p>
            <md>
              <mrow>(-\beta S I)+(\beta S I - \gamma I)+(\gamma I) \amp = 0.</mrow>
            </md> 
            <p>
              Since the three differential equations sum to zero, the change in total population is <m>0</m>. This tells us that the total population in our model does not change. In other words, the size of the total population <m>N(t)</m> remains constant.
            </p>
          </answer>
        </activity>

        <p>
          The analysis in <xref ref="activity-total-population"/> includes the following calculus concepts.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The sum of derivatives equals the derivative of the sum: <m>\frac{dS}{dt}+\frac{dI}{dt}+\frac{dR}{dt} = \frac{d(S+I+R)}{dt}</m>. Therefore <m>\frac{dS}{dt}+\frac{dI}{dt}+\frac{dR}{dt} = \frac{dN}{dt}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              When the derivative of a function equals <m>0</m>, the function is unchanging: <m>\frac{dN}{dt}=0</m> indicates that <m>N(t)</m> is unchanging. 
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In an outbreak that occurs over a relatively short time, it may make complete sense to say that the population is unchanging. It may be that the population truly does not change at all, or it may be that the population is changing so little that we decide not to include population change in a model of the outbreak. Noticing when population change is <m>0</m>, or close to <m>0</m>, allows us to write relatively simple models that do not try to incorporate births, deaths, immigration, emigration, or other population changes. Models that represent a longer span of time may need to account for changes in population.
        </p>
        <p>
          Considering population change requires us to think more deeply about compartment R. We have referred to this compartment as <q>Removed</q>. Some models call the R compartment <q>Recovered</q>. In an outbreak where people all return to full health, calling the R compartment <q>Recovered</q> works well. In an outbreak that causes deaths, one modeling option is to include both deaths and recoveries in the same R compartment. In this case, the name <q>Removed</q> provides a better description. In either case, recognizing that <q>R</q> may stand for differently named compartments is a reminder to us about why we should fully describe each of our models, even if we believe SIR models are well known to our audience: even among SIR models, the interpretations can differ.
        </p>
        <p>For now, we continue to work with an SIR model in which population does not change. We note that some models do need to account for changes in population. As one example, models that represent a longer span of time may incorporate births and deaths. We will see such models later in this text.</p>
        <p>
          Another comment: though we have said our current SIR model probably refers to an outbreak over a relatively short time span, we purposely do not designate amounts of time that are <q>relatively short</q> or <q>longer</q>. This is a choice for the modeler. For each model, a human (the modeler, or perhaps a group working together) makes decisions about whether to list population changes based on length of time or other reasons. They then provide their decisions when describing their models, and they include some form of justification for each decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we go back to the SIR model we have been studying to work through some ways the model solutions can change as parameter values change.
        </p>
        <activity xml:id="activity-three-sets-of-parameters">
          <statement>
            <p>
              Use the code below to create three different graphs of solution curves to an SIR model in which <m>S(0)=75</m>, <m>I(0)=25</m>, <m>R(0)=0</m>, and <m>0 \leq t \leq 20</m>. The first set of values for <m>\beta</m> and <m>\gamma</m> appear in the code block; change the code to get the other two sets of values. It may help you to save screenshots of each of the three graphs, so you can more easily see all three at the same time.

                    Explore the role that changes to <m>\beta</m> make to the outcome in each graph. Similarly, think through how changes to <m>\gamma</m> contribute to changes.

Then use the code block to make several changes to that parameter, and compare what you see with what you thought you would see.

                <p>
                  In the first two graphs, <m>I(t)</m> rises, then falls. For a sign analysis, first write out the differential equation for <m>dI/dt</m>. Then substitute in the values of <m>\beta</m> and <m>\gamma</m> and the initial values <m>S(0)=75</m> and <m>I(0)=25</m> to see that <m>\beta S I - \gamma I \gt 0</m>. Yet <m>S(t)</m> decreases rapidly, until <m>\beta S I - \gamma I \lt 0</m>, and at this time the <m>I(t)</m> curve falls. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the third graph, the <m>I(t)</m> graph has a negative slope from the very beginning. A sign analysis shows why this makes sense, based on the initial value of <m>dI/dt</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  In the first graph, everyone eventually gets sick. The long-term value of <m>S(t)</m> appears to be <m>0</m> and the long-term value of <m>R(t)</m> appears to be <m>100</m>, which is the total population.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the second graph, not everyone gets sick in the outbreak. The <m>S(t)</m> curve appears to level out at a value of approximately <m>8</m>. Extending <c>t_range</c> beyond <m>t=20</m> can help for confirming this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the third graph, quite a few people avoid illness. Estimates for long-term values of <m>S(t)</m> and <m>R(t)</m> can confirm this.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  There is much to say here. In general, increasing <m>\beta</m> makes more people become sick, and makes infection happen more rapidly. Decreasing <m>\gamma</m> leads to more infections. The <m>S(t)</m>, <m>I(t)</m>, and <m>R(t)</m> graphs are all affected by these changes, and the answer to this prompt should include descriptions of these changes.

        <p>
          Both <xref ref="activity-three-sets-of-parameters"/> and <xref ref="expl-rise-and-fall-of-an-epidemic"/> use <em>sign analysis</em>. This usage of the signs (<m>+</m>, <m>-</m>, or <m>0</m>) of a derivative can inform us about circumstances in which a population is increasing, decreasing, or remaining constant. Such knowledge about the relationship between signs and derivatives comes from calculus and is tremendously powerful for understanding epidemics through compartmental modeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us take a moment to emphasize an assumption we make about signs when writing compartmental models. In many applications of mathematics, variables and parameters can take on the values of any real number. However, in compartmental models, we specify that variables and parameters cannot be negative because negative values would not make biological sense. For instance, populations of people cannot be negative, and length of time sick with a disease cannot be negative. Therefore, what we see is what we get: if no negative sign (<m>-</m>) is visible, then a term cannot be negative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a summary of some of the key outcomes in the SIR model from our sign analysis so far. Notice that all these observations arise from calculus concepts.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Sign analysis tells us that <m>S(t)</m> cannot increase: since <m>dS/dt \leq 0</m>, then <m>S(t)</m> can only decrease or remain constant.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Sign analysis tells us that <m>R(t)</m> cannot decrease: since <m>dR/dt \geq 0</m>, then <m>R(t)</m> can only increase or remain constant.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Sign analysis tells us that <m>I(t)</m> has the ability to increase, decrease, or remain constant because the formula for <m>dI/dt</m> can take on values that are positive, negative, or zero.

        <title>The Basic Reproduction Number <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m></title>

        <p>
          It turns out that the SIR model, and many other compartmental models, can be connected with an epidemiological concept called the <term>basic reproduction number</term>. The basic reproduction number is <em>the average number of new infections caused by one infectious person in an otherwise entirely susceptible population</em>. This number is given the symbol <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m>, which is pronounced as <q>R zero</q> or <q>R nought</q>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <xref ref="activity-formula-for-i-of-t-turning-around"/>, we begin to link our SIR model with the concept of <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m>.
        </p>
        
        <activity xml:id="activity-formula-for-i-of-t-turning-around">
          <statement>
            <p>
              This activity examines the <em>boundary</em> between rising and falling <m>I(t)</m> numbers in the SIR model we have been studying. We will see that this boundary relates to important information about the basic reproduction number <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Begin by using the code below to try different values of <m>\beta</m> and <m>\gamma</m>. Your goal is to find values for which the <m>I(t)</m> curve does not rise at first: instead, it stays level or falls. Keep the initial conditions the same, that is, <m>S(0)=1900</m>, <m>I(0)=100</m>, and <m>R(0)=0</m>. If changing the range of <m>t</m> values helps you see the outcome better, then change the end time to a smaller or larger value. However, keep the initial time <m>t=0</m>.   
            </p>
            <p>
              Can you find more than one combination of <m>\beta</m> and <m>\gamma</m> for which the <m>I(t)</m> curve does not rise?
            </p>
            <p>
              You may wish to test your conclusions by viewing model output. To do this, you can modify the Python code provided as part of <xref ref="activity-formula-for-i-of-t-turning-around"/>. Updating the end time of the model simulation may be helpful: rather than end at <m>t=15</m>, consider extending the model for a longer period of time.

              <p>
                Next, consider the equation <m>dI/dt = \beta SI - \gamma I</m> from the SIR model. Under what conditions must <m>dI/dt = 0</m>? Think about these conditions biologically: what interpretations can you give the conditions? 
              </p>
          </statement>
          <hint>
            <p>
              The first part of this is open-ended. There are many combinations of <m>\beta</m> and <m>\gamma</m> for which the <m>I(t)</m> curve falls from the start.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the second part of this, set the right-hand side of the <m>dI/dt</m> equation equal to 0 and factor:
            </p>
            <md>
              <mrow>\beta SI - \gamma I \amp = 0 </mrow>

            </md>
            <p>
              This results in two possibilities: either <m>\beta S - \gamma = 0</m> or <m>I=0</m>. There are multiple biological interpretations of each possibility.
            </p>
          </hint>

        <p>
          Both <xref ref="activity-three-sets-of-parameters"/> and <xref ref="activity-formula-for-i-of-t-turning-around"/> should be leading you to the following conclusions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Smaller values of <m>\beta</m> lead to less growth of the <m>I(t)</m> curve and can help contribute to fewer total people ever becoming Infectious. Smaller <m>\beta</m> corresponds to less infectivity.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Larger values of <m>\gamma</m> also lead to less growth of the <m>I(t)</m> curve and can help contribute to fewer total people ever becoming Infectious. Larger <m>\gamma</m> corresponds to a higher rate of people moving from compartment I to compartment R. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Another way to think of the previous bullet point: smaller values of <m>1/\gamma</m> lead to less growth of the <m>I(t)</m> curve and can help contribute to fewer total people ever becoming Infectious. Given the relationship in <xref ref="eq-gamma-estimate"/>, we see that smaller <m>1/\gamma</m> corresponds to a shorter length of time that people are Infectious.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>\beta</m> and <m>1/\gamma</m> combine into a small enough value, the <m>I(t)</m> curve does not grow, even at the start of a model simulation.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We find that <m>I(t)</m> never grows if <m>dI/dt \leq 0</m> at the start of a simulation, that is, when <m>t=0</m>. This means  
            </p>

              <mrow>\beta S I - \gamma I \amp \leq 0 </mrow>
              <mrow>(\beta S - \gamma) I \amp \leq 0. </mrow>
            </md>
            <p>
              Since <m>I \geq 0</m>, the only way to achieve <m>(\beta S - \gamma) I \lt 0</m> is to have <m>(\beta S - \gamma) \lt 0</m>. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              It would also be possible to have <m>(\beta S - \gamma) I = 0</m> if <m>I=0</m>, but once an outbreak begins, we no longer have <m>I=0</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As a reminder, we said that the basic reproduction number <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> is the average number of new infections caused by one infectious person <em>in an otherwise entirely susceptible population</em>. We are nearly ready to present the formula for <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> in the SIR model
        </p>
        <md>
          <mrow>\frac{dS}{dt} \amp = -\beta S I </mrow>
          <mrow>\frac{dI}{dt} \amp = \beta S I - \gamma I </mrow>
          <mrow>\frac{dR}{dt} \amp = \gamma I. </mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
          However, we first emphasize that <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> describes a phenomenon that occurs in an entirely susceptible population. When <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> is described in the news or popular culture, as happened in many reports on COVID-19, the <q>entirely susceptible population</q> part of the <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> definition is usually left out. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To incorporate the idea of an entirely susceptible population, we refer back to our definition of <em>total population</em> <m>N(t)</m>, which appeared in <xref ref="activity-total-population"/>. In that activity, we showed that <m>N(t)</m> remains constant in this SIR model. We can therefore write <m>N(t)</m> more simply as <m>N</m>, since the value of <m>N</m> does not change over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We now have all the pieces we need to assemble a formula for <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> in the SIR model <xref ref="eq-SIR-model-S"/>, <xref ref="eq-SIR-model-I"/>, and <xref ref="eq-SIR-model-R"/>:
        </p>
        <mdn>
          <mrow xml:id="eq-R0-sir">\mathcal{R}_0 \amp = \frac{\beta N}{\gamma} \mbox{ for our SIR model}. </mrow>
        </mdn>
        <p>
          It is possible to compute the formula for <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> from the equations in a compartmental model. The most common way to do this is called the Next Generation Method. Because the Next Generation Method uses partial derivatives and techniques from linear algebra, it is described in the optional sections <xref ref="ch-the-next-generation-method"/> and <xref ref="ch-the-next-generation-method-connecting-theory-with-practice"/>. In particular, <xref ref="ch-the-next-generation-method"/> teaches the process in a way that can be used by students who are new to matrix operations and partial derivatives: there are a few math techniques to learn, and Python does the rest. Readers who include <xref ref="ch-the-next-generation-method"/> will be able to solve for the formula for <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> in their own models. As an alternative, the <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> formulas for several commonly used compartmental models are provided directly throughout this text.  
        </p>
        <p>
          The numerical value of the <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> formula relates closely to the trajectory of an outbreak. Investigate this in <xref ref="activity-r0-less-than-1"/>.

                  In a typical outbreak, what changes to cause <m>\frac{\beta S}{\gamma}</m> to transition in sign between being positive, negative, and <m>0</m>? What is the expected order of these signs, that is, out of <m>+</m>, <m>-</m>, and <m>0</m>, which happens first in an outbreak, which happens second, and which happens third? Why is this the order?

            </ul>
            <p>
              After completing the above questions, next consider the formula from <xref ref="eq-R0-sir"/>, which says that <m>\mathcal{R}_0 = \frac{\beta N}{\gamma}</m>. Use the work you have already done in this activity, along with the definition of <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> as being the average number of new infections caused by one infectious person <em>in an otherwise entirely susceptible population</em>, to describe what <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> tells us about the behavior of <m>I(t)</m> early in an outbreak.

          </statement>
          <answer>
            <p>
              When <m>\frac{\beta S}{\gamma} \gt 1</m>, then <m>dI/dt \gt 0</m>, which means that the number of Infectious people is increasing. This typically happens early in an outbreak. As the outbreak continues, the value of <m>S</m> becomes smaller, so that eventually <m>\frac{\beta S}{\gamma} = 1</m> (which means <m>dI/dt = 0</m>), and then <m>\frac{\beta S}{\gamma} \lt 1</m> (which means <m>dI/dt \lt 0</m> and the number of Infectious people is decreasing).
            </p>
            <p>
              With one infectious person <em>in an otherwise entirely susceptible population</em>, it is approximately true that <m>S(t)=N</m>, that is, that the Susceptible population is essentially the entire population. Therefore, <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> is a way of indicating what happens to the <m>I(t)</m> population <em>at the very start of an outbreak</em>. 
            </p>
          </answer>
        </activity>

        <p>
          As we have seen in <xref ref="activity-r0-less-than-1"/>, the value of <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> tells us what happens at the very start of an outbreak. This relates to the definition of <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m>, which considers a single infectious person in an otherwise entirely susceptible population.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be more specific, when <m>\mathcal{R}_0 \gt 1</m>, the value of <m>dI/dt</m> is initially positive, which means that the value of <m>I(t)</m> initially increases. Only later, when there are fewer susceptibles, does the graph of <m>I(t)</m> level off and begin to fall. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternately, if <m>\mathcal{R}_0 \lt 1</m>, then the value of <m>dI/dt</m> is initially negative. In this case, the graph of <m>I(t)</m> never rises: it only falls.
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m>, then, tells us whether to expect increasing numbers of Infectious individuals. The specific number <m>1</m> is the boundary between rising and falling values of <m>I(t)</m> when a new infection is first introduced to a susceptible population. We will further see that larger values of <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> correspond to diseases that are more infectious. The concept of <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> will be central to our study of outbreaks.

            Imagine a new outbreak occurs in a small town of 5000 people. Let us suppose it makes sense to model this outbreak with an SIR model, where the compartments are Susceptible (people who are not sick but can become sick), Infectious (people who are currently able to spread the disease), and Removed (people who are no longer able to spread the disease and are unable to become sick again). At the start of the outbreak, a single person is Infectious, and the rest of the people are Susceptible.

Then, based on the value of <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> you compute, answer: what do you think will happen in the short term and in the long term of this outbreak?

                Now suppose that the value of <m>\beta</m> was instead approximated to be <m>0.00001</m>, yet it is still true that <m>\gamma \approx 0.2</m>. Compute the value of <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> in this case. With this value of <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m>, what do you anticipate for the short-term and long-term outcomes of the outbreak?

                Now suppose this outbreak occurs in a town of 1000 people, with <m>\beta \approx 0.0001</m> and <m>\gamma \approx 0.2</m>. Compute the value of <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> for the SIR model in this smaller town. Use this value of <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> to describe what you think will happen in the short term and in the long term of this outbreak.

          <p>
            Most diseases we know of have <m>\mathcal{R}_0 \gt 1</m>. This makes sense: without rising numbers of Infectious people, we do not experience an epidemic. However, in rare cases, a disease emerges for which <m>\mathcal{R}_0 \lt 1</m>. One example is MERS, which stands for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The first identified case of MERS was in 2012. There is still a lot to learn about MERS, but multiple estimates indicate that the value of <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> for MERS is less than one.
          </p>
          <p>
            This activity is motivated by the existence of diseases with <m>\mathcal{R}_0 \lt 1</m>. Suppose we study a disease for which <m>\mathcal{R}_0 \approx 0.5</m> and <m>\gamma = 0.1</m>, that is, people are typically infectious for about ten days. Suppose we choose to model this disease with an SIR model similar to the models we have been using in this chapter: <q>S</q> stands for Susceptible, meaning people who are not sick but can become sick; <q>I</q> stands for Infectious, meaning people who are currently able to spread the disease, and <q>R stands for</q> Removed, meaning people who are no longer able to spread the disease and are unable to become sick again. In the case of a disease similar to MERS, the Removed compartment consists of both recoveries and deaths from the disease.

                Suppose that at the start of the outbreak, 20 people are Infectious. Use the Python block below to visualize the outbreak over 200 days. Notice that the Python block includes three <c>print</c> commands. These print and label the last output values stored as <c>sol</c>, that is, the <m>S(t)</m>, <m>I(t)</m>, and <m>R(t)</m> values for the last value of time <m>t</m>, namely <m>t=200</m>.

      <p>
        In the first few chapters of this text, we have introduced the basic <q>hows</q> for compartmental modeling, as well as a few of the <q>whys</q>. Now, we explore the <q>whys</q> even further.  
      </p>  

      <p>
        One of the most significant ways to use models is for trying and comparing possible public health strategies <em>in simulations</em> before actually carrying them out with real people. Professional-level models can be quite detailed and depend on large amounts of data, and compartmental models are just one of the many types of models implemented. In this chapter, we work with one commonly used strategy: vaccination<fn>Vaccination is a widely used public health strategy. Yet the author of this text recognizes that reader thoughts on vaccines may vary for many reasons. As mentioned way back in the <q>To Students</q> preface, <q>I will not tell you how to think.</q> Instead, the goal of showing vaccines in models is to demonstrate some of the ways we can use models to try different scenarios. Readers can and should continue to think about their own ethics and experiences when interpreting and discussing models</fn>.

        <title>Reducing New Infections</title>
        <introduction>
          <p>
            This exploration seeks to reduce the number of new infections by directly reducing the transmission part of the compartmental SIR model shown in <xref ref="eq-SIR-model-S"/>, <xref ref="eq-SIR-model-I"/>, and <xref ref="eq-SIR-model-R"/>. To reduce transmission, we multiply by a term <m>(1-p)</m>:  
          </p>
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{dS}{dt} \amp = - (1-p) \beta S I </mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{dI}{dt} \amp =  (1-p) \beta S I - \gamma I </mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{dR}{dt} \amp = \gamma I. </mrow>
          </md>
          <p>
            This change to the model reflects that the term <m>\beta SI</m> in the SIR model represents transmission of disease from the Infectious to the Susceptible population. To reduce transmission, we therefore change the specific term <m>\beta SI</m> by introducing the multiplier <m>(1-p)</m>. 
          </p> 
          <p>
            Work through the parts below to build understanding of the term <m>(1-p)</m> and the permissible values of <m>p</m>.

      <section xml:id="sec-vaccines-in-compartmental-models">
        <title>Vaccines in Compartmental Models</title>

        <p>
          The modeling in this section focuses on <em>reducing transmission of a disease through the use of vaccines</em>. We use the multiplier <m>(1-p)</m> from <xref ref="expl-activity-vaccines"/>, along with the concept of <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> from <xref ref="ch-model-analysis-and-the-basic-reproduction-number-R0"/>, to demonstrate the effect of vaccines on the number of people who ever become Infectious in a disease outbreak.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a reminder, the <em>basic reproduction number</em> <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> is the average number of new infections caused by one infectious person in an otherwise entirely susceptible population. This means that <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> is not a number we can use to directly describe a population that has been vaccinated against a disease, since a vaccinated population is not entirely susceptible. Instead, we introduce an <term>effective reproduction number</term> <m>\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}}</m>, which is the average number of new infections caused by one infectious person in a population that may not be entirely susceptible, such as a population that has had access to vaccination. One way to pronounce the symbol <m>\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}}</m> is <q>R effective</q>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We cannot change the intrinsic value of <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m>, but with vaccination, we can work toward the goal of having <m>\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}} \lt 1</m>. If <m>\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}} \lt 1</m> in a model that includes vaccines or other public health interventions, then overall numbers of Infectious people do not rise over time. With a few lines of algebra, we can build a relationship between <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m>, <m>p</m>, and <m>\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}}</m>. 
        </p> 
        <p>
          First, we should state a definition for <m>p</m>. We define <m>p</m> to be the fraction of people vaccinated against a disease, noting that the values of <m>p</m> are therefore restricted to <m>0 \leq p \leq 1</m>, where <m>p=0</m> means no one is vaccinated, and <m>p=1</m> means <m>100\%</m> of the population is vaccinated. Initially, we will think of vaccination as being <m>100\%</m> effective.<fn>In the last exercise of <xref ref="exercises-ch-vaccines"/>, we update our models to include vaccines that are less than <m>100\%</m> effective.</fn>
          When the fraction <m>p</m> of people are vaccinated, the remaining fraction <m>(1-p)</m> are not vaccinated. Since <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> refers to an entirely susceptible population, but only the fraction <m>(1-p)</m> of the population is susceptible, we see that the average number of new infections caused by one infectious person in the vaccinated population is <m>(1-p)\mathcal{R}_0</m>. In other words:
        </p>
        
        <mdn>
          <mrow xml:id="eq-Reff-define">\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}} \amp = (1-p)\mathcal{R}_0. </mrow>
        </mdn>

        <p>
          Our goal in the next few mathematical steps is to use <xref ref="eq-Reff-define"/> to determine a value of <m>p</m> for which <m>\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}} \lt 1</m>.<fn>The goal of <m>\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}} \lt 1</m> was set out in the 1983 paper  <q>Parasitic Infections as Regulators of Animal Populations</q> by Robert M. May, published in <em>American Scientist</em> in the January-February issue. Additional details and explanation appear in the 1988 textbook <q>Mathematical Models in Biology</q> by Leah Edelstein-Keshet, published by McGraw-Hill.</fn> Such a value of <m>p</m> corresponds to a vaccination rate high enough that a disease cannot become an outbreak because <m>\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}} \lt 1</m> means that the overall numbers in the population are not expected to rise. Read carefully through the following mathematical steps to see how this value of <m>p</m> is computed:

          In the lines above, we started with our goal of causing <m>\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}}</m> to be less than one. We then made a substitution using <xref ref="eq-Reff-define"/> and rearranged algebraically until we found a formula showing values of <m>p</m> that satisfied our goal. Notice that to compute the next-to-last line, we divided by <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> without changing the direction of the inequality, which assumed that <m>\mathcal{R}_0 \gt 0</m>. This assumption makes biological sense, and is important to point out mathematically, as biology and mathematics should support each other throughout the modeling process.

        <p>
          We now note a particular, special value of <m>p</m> that is the threshold between two outcomes, which makes it a <term>critical value</term>. The two outcomes are having, or not having, an outbreak. We therefore name this critical value of <m>p</m> to be <m>p_{\text{crit}}</m>:

                  Smallpox has been eliminated: the last natural occurrence was in 1977, and in 1980, the World Health Organization stated that smallpox had been globally eradicated. Measles has not been eliminated: widespread vaccination has reduced cases drastically in many parts of the world, but measles continues to circulate. Given your results in this activity about the values of <m>p_{\text{crit}}</m> for smallpox and measles, write a few sentences about how <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> contributes toward making it more or less feasible to vaccinate enough people to eliminate a disease.

                  For smallpox, <m>0.71 \lt p_{\text{crit}} \lt 0.83</m>, meaning approximately <m>71\% - 83\%</m> of people need to be vaccinated to prevent an outbreak.

          The investigations of <xref ref="activity-pcrit"/> asked you to compute values of <m>p_{\text{crit}}</m> for specific diseases. Another aspect of <m>p_{\text{crit}}</m> is that achieving this critical vaccination level means only that the infection curve, that is, the <m>I(t)</m> curve, falls from the beginning rather than rising first. However, this does not mean that there are no new infections after the initial cases. Explore this further in <xref ref="activity-pcrit2"/>.

                  How many people have had this illness at some point in time, according to this model with its default values? To answer this: notice that everyone who reaches the R compartment must have been sick at some time, so the long-term value of <m>R(t)</m> provides the answer. Also notice that we need to make sure to run the model long enough that <m>I(t)</m> reaches <m>0</m>. Only then will <m>R(t)</m> be evaluated at a large enough value of <m>t</m> for us to know the total number of people who become ill.

                  Compute the value <m>p_{\text{crit}}</m> for this model, showing your work. Then run the model using the value you computed for <m>p_{\text{crit}}</m> and re-answer the question above: how many people get the illness at some point in time, according to this model, when <m>p=p_{\text{crit}}</m>? 
                </p>

                  Compare your answer above, regarding how many people get the illness at some time in the situation when <m>p=p_{\text{crit}}</m>, with the initial number of Infectious people in the model. How many people must have gotten the illness sometime after the original Infectious people? Notice that this means that even when <m>\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}} \approx 1</m>, a significant number of additional people can contract the illness being studied. However, the Infectious population curve <m>I(t)</m> does not rise: it instead appears as level or decreasing.

                  We may want to see for ourselves, or demonstrate to others, that the Infectious curve is truly not rising when <m>p=p_{\text{crit}}</m>. The default graph in the Python code for this activity is not the most helpful to us because <m>S(0)</m> is so large relative to <m>I(0)</m>, which makes it challenging to see the details of the curvature of the <m>I(t)</m> curve. To see <em>just</em> the <m>I(t)</m> curve, then, we can comment out the lines of code that show the <m>S(t)</m> and <m>R(t)</m> curves. Do this: comment out those lines, and produce a graph showing just the <m>I(t)</m> curve.

          We now pause our modeling for a moment to provide some extra vocabulary and commentary on vaccines. When vaccines are studied and approved for use, researchers demonstrate their <term>efficacy</term> and <term>effectiveness</term>. Both terms consider how many people within a population of vaccinated individuals get a disease, compared with how many people within a comparable population of unvaccinated individuals get the same disease. If, for instance, <m>75\%</m> fewer people in the vaccinated population get the disease, then we say the vaccine has an efficacy or effectiveness of <m>75\%</m>.<fn>Notice what the <m>75\%</m> does NOT mean: it does NOT mean that only <m>75\%</m> of people are protected by the vaccine, or that the vaccine only <q>works</q> <m>75\%</m> of the time.</fn> The word <em>efficacy</em> specifies that the comparison of vaccinated and unvaccinated populations happens within a clinical trial. The word <em>effectiveness</em> indicates that the vaccine is being studied for populations in the real world. While clinical trials do include a range of different people, effectiveness often differs from efficacy.
        </p>

          Nice explanations of the meanings of <em>efficacy</em> and <em>effectiveness</em> can be found at the <url href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/vaccine-efficacy-effectiveness-and-protection">Vaccine efficacy, effectiveness and protection</url> page from the World Health Organization.

        <p>
          Vaccine outcomes extend beyond affecting disease transmission. One common outcome is reducing the intensity of illness in individuals who have been vaccinated, yet who still become sick. This and other outcomes can be included in models, however such models tend to be more detailed than those we are studying right now. For this reason, this chapter focuses only on vaccine models that show reduced transmission.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much of this section has focused on vaccines, which are a valuable element of compartmental models. Another important aspect of disease spread is the incubation period of an illness. The SEIR model, described in <xref ref="sec-including-an-incubation-period-the-seir-model"/>, incorporates this incubation period.

          We introduce here the <term>SEIR model</term>. The new compartment, E, stands for <em>Exposed-and-incubating</em>.

                  One key aspect of this diagram is that the term <m>\beta SI</m> appears on the arrow from <m>S</m> to <m>E</m>. In the SIR model, the arrow from <m>S</m> to <m>I</m> involved exactly the compartments at its beginning and end, but with the SEIR model, there is a different pattern.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Notice the arrow labeled <m>\kappa E</m>. The flow out of the E compartment depends only on the population <m>E(t)</m> and the amount of time typically spent as Exposed-and-incubating, similar to how the flow out of the I compartment in the SIR and SEIR models depends only on the population <m>I(t)</m> and the amount of time spent as Infectious. An important comment here is that this answer key uses the parameter <m>\kappa</m> for the rate governing the flow out of the E compartment, but there is no reason at all that you should have chosen the Greek letter <m>\kappa</m> for this rate! Whatever letter you chose, as long as it is not a letter already in use elsewhere in the model, is an excellent choice.

                  Your answers for the first two parts should definitely be compatible. If they are not, whether in this activity or ever in your modeling career, then that is a time to re-evaluate your work. This is one of many ways we can double-check our modeling work: when we describe a model in different formats, such as in a diagram and by means of equations, the different formats should agree with each other.

        <p>
          Now that you have built an SEIR model in <xref ref="activity-seir-model-intro"/>, you can explore its compartmental diagram and differential equations. To start, notice that we can estimate the value of <m>\kappa</m> similarly to how we estimated the value of <m>\gamma</m> in <xref ref="eq-gamma-estimate"/> and <xref ref="eq-gamma-estimate-2"/>, using the average incubation time for a disease:         
        </p>
        <mdn>
          <mrow xml:id="eq-kappa-estimate">\frac{1}{\kappa} \amp \approx \mbox{average length of time an individual spends in compartment E} </mrow>
        </mdn>
        <p>
          or:
        </p>
        <mdn>
          <mrow xml:id="eq-kappa-estimate-2">\frac{1}{\kappa} \amp \approx \mbox{average incubation time for a disease.} </mrow>
        </mdn>

        <p>
          Next, it is helpful with the newly introduced SEIR model to envision how solutions should look, understand how the value of the new parameter <m>\kappa</m> affects solutions, and simply play around with the equations and different parameter values so that you can build your intuition for this model. Begin these investigations in <xref ref="activity-seir-model-play-with-kappa"/>. 
        </p>

        <activity xml:id="activity-seir-model-play-with-kappa">

            <p>
              This activity provides a venue for you to play with the SEIR model. Begin by thinking through how you expect SEIR solution curves to appear, and then use Python code to create these solutions and see how they respond to changing parameters.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Do a brief sign analysis of the SEIR model. Is it possible for the <m>S(t)</m>, <m>I(t)</m>, or <m>R(t)</m> curves in the SEIR model to behave in any ways that are fundamentally different than how these curves behave in the SIR model? In particular: within <xref ref="sec-using-calculus-to-analyze-models"/> we discussed the ways these three curves in the SIR model could fall, or rise and fall, or rise. Can these curves behave any differently in the SEIR model? And what does sign analysis tell you about how the <m>E(t)</m> model can possibly behave? 
                </p>
              </li>              
              <li>
                <p>
                  Run the Python code below, and observe the curve <m>E(t)</m>. Does it behave the way you predicted in the first part of this Activity? (It should.) 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next, make a note of the long-term number of people who become sick in this model. Then make <m>\kappa</m> larger and note the newly computed long-term number of people who become sick in the model. Try this for multiple values of <m>\kappa</m>. What pattern(s) do you observe?  
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Continue the Python investigation of different values of <m>\kappa</m>. Start with <m>\kappa = 0.1</m>, then run the model with <m>\kappa = 0.2</m>, <m>\kappa = 0.3</m>, and so on, up to <m>\kappa = 1.0</m>. Describe how the <m>E(t)</m> curve changes as <m>\kappa</m> goes through these changes. Notice that you can focus in on the <m>E(t)</m> curve by commenting out the other three solution curves, similarly to how we did in <xref ref="activity-pcrit2"/>.

                  As in the SIR model: the <m>S(t)</m> curve can only fall or remain level. The <m>I(t)</m> curve can both rise and fall, and can remain level. The <m>R(t)</m> curve can only rise or remain level.

The answer appears below, yet this is a great time to test yourself. Completing the steps and confirming your results below lets you gain practice now, before perhaps trying to compute <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> on a future model where no answer is given.

          The formula in <xref ref="eq-R0-seir"/> can be rearranged in order to use information about <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m>, <m>\gamma</m>, and <m>N</m> to compute a reasonable range of <m>\beta</m> values in a model. We have seen how to estimate <m>\gamma</m> and <m>\kappa</m> in <xref ref="eq-gamma-estimate"/>, <xref ref="eq-gamma-estimate-2"/>, <xref ref="eq-kappa-estimate"/>, and <xref ref="eq-kappa-estimate"/>.

            We are now ready to set up a compartmental model for whooping cough, also called pertussis, in a fictional town having 10,000 residents, using information from the <url href="https://www.health.ny.gov/publications/2171/">New York State Pertussis or Whooping Cough Fact Sheet</url>. The fact sheet says that the first stage of pertussis, in which symptoms are similar to those of a cold, lasts one to two weeks. Stage two, which includes the severe cough that gave pertussis the name <q>whooping cough</q>, lasts one to two months. The fact sheet also says that pertussis is contagious from the time cold symptoms appear until about three weeks after severe cough starts. The incubation period for pertussis is most often seven to ten days: the incubation period can sometimes be longer, but we focus on the most common lengths of time. We will not include the use of antibiotics in this model.

Notice that the code will compute the appropriate value of <m>\beta</m>, using the total population of 10,000 and the values you assign to <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> and <m>\gamma</m>. Make observations about the outcomes of the model. Be sure to adjust the length of time the model runs, or to show just one or two solution curves at a time, or to otherwise alter the code so that you can best see and comment on the results of the model.

                  Pertussis begins to be contagious when cold symptoms appear, and the phase for cold symptoms is one to two weeks. Pertussis is most contagious for up to three weeks after the intense coughing phase begins. Adding these phases together, pertussis is contagious, or most contagious, for four to five weeks, meaning 28 to 35 days. So <m>\gamma</m> is in the range <m>\frac{1}{35}- \frac{1}{28}</m>. (Saying <q>up to</q> three weeks suggests people may not be contagious the full three weeks. And pertussis may be contagious, at a lower level, more than three weeks after severe cough begins.

          Now that we have discussed public health intervention in the form of vaccines, as well as SI, SIR, and SEIR models, we have learned enough to be able to mathematically model the primary dynamics of many disease outbreaks. <em>These ideas are the core of this course.</em> In <xref ref="ch-getting-the-answer-right-in-modeling"/> we will think through the big ideas inherent in mathematical modeling. The remaining chapters in <xref ref="part-core-modeling-concepts"/> focus on connecting data with models and working with two additional ways to significantly extend our use of compartmental models: endemic disease, in <xref ref="ch-epidemic-vs-endemic-models"/>, and modeling ideas other than diseases, in <xref ref="ch-modeling-the-spread-of-a-rumor"/>.

            Redo <xref ref="activity-seir-model-pertussis-setup"/>, but convert the time unit to <em>weeks</em> instead of <em>days</em>. To make this change, do the following.

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Compute the number of weeks for the incubation period of pertussis. This should be <m>\mbox{(the number of days of the incubation period)} / 7</m>. When you then compute <m>\kappa</m>, you should obtain a value equal to <m>7 * \mbox{(the value you obtained in the previous exercise)}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Similarly, the value of <m>\gamma</m> in this exercise should be <m>7 * \mbox{(the value you obtained in the previous exercise)}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                For the graphs to appear the same, the horizontal axis should be adjusted. To be precise, the length of the new time axis should equal <m>\mbox{(the length of the time axis in the previous exercise) } / 7</m>. To be close, use the nearest number of weeks. For instance, the default time length in the previous exercise is 365 days, which is one year. One year has approximately, but not exactly, 52 weeks. Using 52 weeks in this exercise will give a very similar graph to the 365-day graph from the previous exercise.

          <p>
            Explain mathematically why the unit conversions described in parts (a.), (b.), and (c.) are the correct conversions for converting the model's time scale from days to weeks. Show graphs from both this exercise and the previous exercise to demonstrate that the model results are the same when we convert the units of time. For better clarity: update the label for the time axis in each graph to say <q>days</q> or <q>weeks</q> instead of <q>time</q>, to make clear which time unit is being used in the graph.

            We make one more update to the pertussis model in <xref ref="activity-seir-model-pertussis-setup"/>, addressing vaccine efficacy. Our inclusion of the multiplier <m>(1-p)</m> assumed that vaccination had <m>100 \%</m> efficacy or effectiveness. However, research into pertussis vaccines shows that the level of vaccine efficacy or effectiveness can be significantly less. There is a wide range of values, depending on the specific vaccine used, the location in the world, and the years of study. For this exercise, we use a range of <m>80-85\%</m> efficacy.<fn>This range of vaccine efficacy level comes from the <url href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/pert.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</url>.

          Mathematical modeling allows us to represent real-world scenarios with mathematical formulas. Models may primarily reflect what is happening in the world, giving us a mathematical way to describe what we see. Alternately, we may use models to think about how to change what is happening in the world. We can make changes mathematically, trying ideas within models, before ever trying to implement those ideas as policies or medical interventions involving actual people.

           Many people believe that mathematics is all about getting <q>the right answer</q>. With mathematical modeling, there may not be a <q>right answer</q>, or even a best answer. For instance, in <xref ref="expl-activity-getting-the-answer-right"/> there may be multiple reasonable answers to some of the questions. In modeling, the answers we seek depend on the questions we ask, the priorities we set, the way we use models to explore these questions, and our ability to explain all these pieces of our thought process.

        <p>
          You could say that modeling consists of four components:

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Making <em>changes</em> to models as we gain more information, to better represent a situation, to answer different questions, or to try alternate scenarios;

          <title>The Logical Approach</title>

          <p>
            Throughout mathematics, we set up statements in a particular logical way. We will see that researchers follow similar principles when describing mathematical models.
          </p>
          <p>
             The structure of mathematical statements typically involves <q>if</q> and <q>then</q> statements, such as: <q><em>If</em> a polygon has six sides and six angles, <em>then</em> the polygon is a hexagon.</q> The <q>if</q> statements are called <em>assumptions</em>. The <q>then</q> statements are called <em>conclusions</em>. A mathematical statement may include multiple assumptions and/or multiple conclusions. The words <q>if</q> and <q>then</q> are not always included, so we as readers may need to think carefully about which parts of a mathematical statement are the assumptions and which parts are the conclusions.
          </p> 
          <p>
            Work through <xref ref="activity-mathematical-logic-sections"/> to build familiarity with identifying the assumptions and conclusions in mathematical statements.

                Mathematical statements are typically structured in terms of <q>if</q> and <q>then</q> statements, such as: <q><em>If</em> the weather forecast calls for rain, <em>then</em> I will bring my raincoat.</q> There may be several <q>if</q> statements, and these are collectively called <term>assumptions</term>. There may be many <q>then</q> statements, and these are called <term>conclusions</term>.

                For each of the following mathematical statements, specify which part is the <em>hypothesis</em>, that is, the <q>if</q> part of the statement. Also specify which part is the <em>conclusion</em>, that is, the <q>then</q> part.

There could be even more assumptions listed, such as if we want to say that having a shape be a polygon is itself a hypothesis.

In this model, the S compartment contains the Susceptibles, that is, people who are not sick but can become sick. The I compartment contains the Infectious, that is, people who are currently able to spread the disease. The R compartment contains the Removed, that is, people who are no longer able to spread the disease and are unable to become sick again. Suppose we estimate the parameters to be <m>\beta \approx 0.0001</m> and <m>\gamma \approx 0.4</m>. If, at the start of the outbreak, ten people are Infectious and the rest are Susceptible, then by the end of the outbreak, the model suggests that <m>1071</m> will remain Susceptible, that is, <m>1071</m> people will never have become Infectious.

            We have learned in this section that a model includes statements to create a very specific scenario. Whatever conclusions there may be from the model, we should expect them to occur <em>only in the scenario created by the assumptions</em>. If any of the assumptions change, then we should not expect any of the same conclusions to occur.
          </p>
          <p>
            In mathematical statements and model scenarios: it is not completely impossible to see some of the same conclusions, even if we change the assumptions. We are not saying that it is impossible to end up at the same conclusion. Instead, our emphasis is that we <em>should not expect</em> the conclusion to be the same. All our discussion about the model should include this logical connection between assumptions and conclusions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the purely logical relationship between the <q>ifs</q> and <q>thens</q> of model statements, there are priorities built into any model. We discuss this in <xref ref="sec-priorities-where-goals-meet-ethics"/>.

        <section xml:id="sec-priorities-where-goals-meet-ethics">
          <title>Priorities: Where Goals Meet Ethics</title>
          <p>
            Each model is based on the priorities of the people who create the model. Recognizing this, and thinking about it from the start, makes us better modelers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The word <q>priorities</q> can take on many meanings. One key priority in model building is <em>answering a question</em>. For instance, in <xref ref="ch-vaccines-and-incubation-periods"/> we described models that address questions about how helpful vaccines or isolation can be in preventing an outbreak or reducing the effects of an outbreak. Different questions may require different models.
          </p>
          <p>
            There may be other priorities as well, and we may not even realize when we start model building that we are incorporating those priorities. A student project I once advised produced one very powerful example of priorities that we do not see initially. This project forms the idea behind <xref ref="activity-priorities-HIV-AIDS"/>. Though this student put tremendous thought and research into creating their model, <em>the results of the model showed</em> that the student's priorities had not been properly built into the model. This new understanding led the student to revise the model to better include their priorities.

The model shown below is a simplification of the model this student produced, yet still includes the key ideas.

                    Many modelers, at the time this student was working, indicated that patients with AIDS were typically too sick to spread the virus to others. Therefore patients with AIDS, according to models, did not contribute to new cases of HIV. The same hypothesis is part of this model: people in the I compartment can cause new infections, but people in the A compartment cannot.

                    This model lasts many years, so it includes births and deaths. All births are assumed to be Susceptible, and births occur at a constant rate <m>\Pi</m>.

                This model has more pieces than the models we have seen before. It may take some time to think through these pieces! <em>Begin by taking a significant amount of time to view the compartmental diagram in <xref ref="fig-SIA-compartmental-diagram"/> and read the ideas that led to the model's development. Be sure you understand them.</em> Then respond to the following questions.

                    The student project that inspired this Activity examined government strategies for spending limited funds designated for public health. Write about at least four ways government funds could be used to address health-related issues connected with HIV and AIDS. Include funding for HIV/AIDS prevention as well as funding for the care of those who are sick. 
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    This student project had a goal of determining how government funds should be allocated, given a goal of reducing the number of new HIV infections as much as possible. For each way you described how government funds could be used, do your best to indicate how those funds would affect the model in <xref ref="fig-SIA-compartmental-diagram"/>. For example, the number of people in a compartment could be affected, or one of the rate parameters could be increased or decreased. Explain your reasoning.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Given a fixed amount of funding, and a goal of decreasing new HIV infections as much as possible, the results of this student project prescribed a very stark allocation of funding. Thinking through all the ways you thought funding could be used, and thinking about the stated goal of decreasing new HIV infections: can you guess what this student project found in its results?

Then consider carefully why this approach to modeling produced this answer, and give some examples of what would need to change in the modeling process in order to give a different answer.

                The model indicated that no funds at all should be spent on treating patients with AIDS: no medicines, no hospital beds, nothing.

          </activity>

          <p>
            The example in <xref ref="activity-priorities-HIV-AIDS"/> provides an important insight: <em>We may think we know what questions we are answering with our models, but we should continue to interrogate our answers in relation to our goals, priorities, and ethics.</em> The outcome of the model in <xref ref="activity-priorities-HIV-AIDS"/> did not fit the goals or ethics of the student doing the project. The result from the mathematical model highlighted built-in priorities of the model that the student (and I) did not notice at first. When new infections are completely unaffected by the people in the A compartment, then treating those people, or providing them any healthcare at all, is irrelevant to the goals of the model. However, leaving large numbers of people without healthcare was never the goal of this project. The model needed to be revised to account for this.
          </p>

          <p>
            You may have noticed that the example in <xref ref="activity-priorities-HIV-AIDS"/> provides yet another important insight: <em>The results of a model may draw attention to assumptions we had not realized we were making.</em> Many researchers producing HIV/AIDS models were using models in which patients with AIDS did not contribute to new cases of HIV, so we used the same assumption. However, this led to a model whose outcome indicated that an optimal allocation of funds meant AIDS patients would receive no healthcare. This made brute logical sense, but it showed that we needed to update the model to have an expectation of healthcare for AIDS patients. <em>Models help us see situations in a new light. Even when a model's results are not what we hoped for, the process of modeling often improves our understanding of the system we are studying.</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            We have just seen an example in which updating a model was crucial. More generally, the process of modeling nearly always involves revision. We restructure models when we spot errors, or when we are able to access better data, or when we begin by asking some questions and then shift to different questions. Updating models is the focus of <xref ref="sec-making-changes-to-models"/>.

          <p>
            The setup of a model matters. Definitions of compartments and rate parameters matter. Initial conditions, such as initial numbers of people in the population of each compartment, matter. All aspects of a model should reflect our priorities and goals, as described in <xref ref="sec-priorities-where-goals-meet-ethics"/>, and should fit together logically, as described in <xref ref="sec-the-logical-approach"/>. We may endeavor to get all these model details right on the first try, incorporating research into the disease being modeled and the populations involved in the outbreak. Yet the act of building and using a model often shows us more details to consider, such as what was described in <xref ref="activity-priorities-HIV-AIDS"/>. Other changes to models may be motivated by asking different questions, gathering new data, updating information about an outbreak, or many other reasons. <em>Making changes to models is a central part of the modeling process</em>.

            When COVID-19 first emerged, people had lots of questions, and data were being updated all the time. This was a disease that was truly new, and mathematical models were (and still are) a way to build understanding. Work through <xref ref="activity-changing-models-COVID-19"/> to address some of the questions people immediately had about COVID-19. Importantly: the models in <xref ref="activity-changing-models-COVID-19"/> are inspired by the questions circulating early in the COVID-19 outbreak, but different regions throughout the world experienced COVID-19 in different ways, and the models here are not meant to address every circumstance. In other words: <em>the models here cannot fully and accurately represent early COVID-19</em>, as worldwide outbreaks were more complex. However, by considering public health interventions and changing models to examine the outcomes of these interventions, we learn more about how such interventions affect the trajectory of an outbreak.

                For this activity, we model a simplified version of early COVID-19 using an SEIR model in which the compartment definitions may differ from what we have seen before. For each question below, part of the response includes clarifying the definitions of compartments. Here are comments on each compartment, where terms such as <q>could</q>, <q>may</q>, and <q>in some cases</q> indicate aspects of compartment definitions that change, depending on how we define the compartments in a specific model.
              </p>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    Susceptibles (S) are people who have not yet become sick, and who can become sick. The Susceptibles could, in some cases, include people who have been vaccinated and therefore have less chance of becoming sick.  
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    The Exposed-and-incubating (E) compartment includes people who have gotten the COVID-19 virus but not yet become infectious, and this class may include people with and without vaccination. 
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    The Infectious (I) compartment includes people who are currently infectious, regardless of the severity of their symptoms, and in some cases, people in the Infectious compartment are also assumed to be interacting with Susceptibles. 
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    The Removed (R) compartment may consist of people who have recovered from COVID-19, died from COVID-19, or entirely isolated themselves from others, so that they cannot spread COVID-19 at all.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The equations for the SEIR model are below. Use these, along with the Python code block, to answer the questions that follow.  
              </p>
              <p>
                For questions 2, 3, and possibly 4, first <em>imagine how changes to initial population values or parameter values can change outcomes in the model</em>. That is, truly think through this in your mind, and write down your thoughts, before proceeding with changes. For reference, the values in the original model are based very loosely on Lombardy, Italy, in early 2020. The total population was approximately ten million. The value of <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> was estimated to be <m>2.6-3.3</m>, and <m>\kappa</m> is estimated at about <m>1/6.5</m>.<fn>These estimates come from the paper <q>The early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Lombardy, Italy</q> by many researchers, published in the journal <em>Epidemics</em> in December 2021.</fn> The value of <m>\gamma</m> is <m>1/14</m>, indicating an average of two weeks of being infectious. This is based on many reports suggesting that most people were infectious for one to two weeks, but that some people were infectious for much longer. There was vast variation on how early COVID-19 affected people, which is part of the reason we need to consider changes and updates to models.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next, try your changes in Python, creating before-and-after graphs. The code block includes sections titled <q>original model</q> and <q>your changes to the model</q>: scroll through to the <q>your changes to the model</q> version to make updates. Then go to the <q>plotting commands</q> section to choose the compartments for which you would like to show graphs; the default is to show I(t) for both the original and updated versions. Notice that if you were to show all four compartments, before and after, there would be eight total curves, which can be complicated for a reader to understand. Instead, prioritize the graphs that best illustrate your findings, probably showing no more than two or four total graphs at a time.

                    How would you define each compartment in the very early stages of COVID-19, when most people did not yet know this was a new disease, and no public health measures had yet been instituted to try to contain the outbreak?

                  <p>
                    Early public health measures aimed to <q>flatten the curve</q>. The idea was that, even without vaccines or COVID-19-specific medicines, we could slow the spread of the outbreak by having people stay distant from each other. Which parameter(s) in the SEIR model are most affected when people maintain physical distance from each other? Try changing the parameter(s) you have chosen in the Python block and compare your results with the original result.

                    Creating COVID-19 vaccines was an early goal, one that people were modeling long before vaccines became available.<fn>In some parts of the world, there has been significant controversy about the use of vaccines for COVID-19. This book does not require readers to have any one opinion about vaccine usage. We use models to address questions about vaccines, and readers are invited to do the same, building models that represent different vaccine-based outcomes and using those models to determine outcomes and dynamics of COVID-19, with and without vaccines.</fn> The plan was for vaccines to address COVID-19 in multiple ways; we will address two such ways here. One way was for people to be less likely to get COVID-19. Another way was to reduce the severity or length of time ill for people who did get COVID-19. For each of these ways of addressing COVID-19: which compartments and/or parameters in the SEIR model are affected? Prepare before-and-after versions of the model, carefully defining each compartment and parameter in the before model and again in the after model. Then use the Python graph to generate graphs comparing the outcomes before and after vaccines.

        <title>Writing Explanations to Present Models to Others</title>
        
        <p>
          Doing mathematical work, and presenting that mathematical work, are two related yet different tasks. Moreover, mathematical work is just one part of the bigger process of building a model, justifying the assumptions within the model, determining the possible outcomes of the model, and explaining the possible solutions and outcomes of the model. In this section, we discuss the presentation of modeling results through careful writing and organization. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Students who take a course in modeling sometimes come from a mathematical background in which explanations are sparse. A question such as <q>What is the value of <m>3</m> times <m>5~</m>?</q> may not require any explanation. (A more fun question might be, <q>What are two different ways to demonstrate that <m>3</m> times <m>5</m> equals <m>15~</m>?</q>. How would your approach to responding change if the question were phrased this way?) My experience teaching a variety of math courses is that students have not always experienced the value of explanation, prior to a modeling course. We address this directly so that each student's models make the most sense, and the impacts of each model are as meaningful and powerful as they can be. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We have discussed writing and presentation already in this text, and we will continue to do so throughout. Notably, <xref ref="ch-writing-tips-for-math-and-planning-for-peer-review"/> focuses entirely on writing, specifically when writing mathematics and writing about mathematical models. Within this chapter, our focus is on unifying these four components of modeling: a logical approach, clearly stated priorities, making any appropriate changes to a model, and constructing meaningful explanations of the results of our models. Try this in <xref ref="activity-writing-explanations-to-present-models"/>.

              Imagine a residential college campus experiences an outbreak of flu, which is also called influenza. The incubation period for influenza is usually one to four days, and most often about two days. People tend to be sick with influenza for a few days to less than two weeks, and in most people, less than one week<fn>Facts on incubation period and period of contagion are shown in the CDC's <em>Key Facts About Influenza</em> page: <url href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/keyfacts.htm"></url>.</fn>. The value of <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> for influenza is typically between 1 and 2<fn>This summary of <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> values comes from the Virginia Department of Health (<url href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/2022/01/07/covid-19-and-influenza-surveillance"></url>), and many other research articles and websites report on <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> estimates.</fn>, and many people in a population tend to have some immunity or protection from influenza, either because they have been sick with a related strain of influenza in the past, or because they have received an influenza vaccine, or for both reasons.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Decide on a model that you would use for an influenza outbreak on the campus you are imagining. Write out your reasons for the modeling decisions you make. Ideas to consider include: which compartmental model? How many people are involved, and what are the initial numbers of people in each compartment? What are the parameter values? What ranges of values may be possible for initial values and parameter values? There may be yet other aspects of your model to describe and explain.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Ask some questions of your model. Two sample questions are, <q>What happens if the campus vastly increases its number and distribution of hand sanitizing stations?</q> and <q>How much do the model's results change as the initial number of infectious people changes?</q>. There are many other questions you can ask. Use Python code blocks from elsewhere in the text to answer your questions. Select a code block that includes the type of model you are using (such as SIR, SEIR, and possibly vaccination) and make whatever changes you need. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once you have addressed each question, write about your results. Include information about what question you asked and why it was a reasonable question, given the outbreak being studied. In addition to writing your response using words, incorporate other evidence, such as graphs and long-term values of Susceptibles or other compartments. Think throughout about structuring your response logically; indicating your priorities; explaining the change you made and why you made it; and explaining what happened when you made that change.

                  Creating COVID-19 vaccines was an early goal, one that people were modeling long before vaccines became available.<fn>In some parts of the world, there has been significant controversy about the use of vaccines for COVID-19. This book does not require readers to have any one opinion about vaccine usage. We use models to address questions about vaccines, and readers are invited to do the same, building models that represent different vaccine-based outcomes and using those models to determine outcomes and dynamics of COVID-19, with and without vaccines.</fn> The plan was for vaccines to address COVID-19 in multiple ways; we will address two such ways here. One way was for people to be less likely to get COVID-19. Another way was to reduce the severity or length of time ill for people who did get COVID-19. For each of these ways of addressing COVID-19: which compartments and/or parameters in the SEIR model are affected? Prepare before-and-after versions of the model, carefully defining each compartment and parameter in the before model and again in the after model. Then use the Python graph to generate graphs comparing the outcomes before and after vaccines.

                  Susceptibles (S) are people who have not yet become sick, and who can become sick. The Susceptibles could, in some cases, include people who have been vaccinated and therefore have less chance of becoming sick.  
                </p>

                  The Exposed-and-incubating (E) compartment includes people who have gotten the COVID-19 virus but not yet become infectious, and this class may include people with and without vaccination.

                  The Infectious (I) compartment includes people who are currently infectious, regardless of the severity of their symptoms, and in some cases, people in the Infectious compartment are also assumed to be interacting with Susceptibles.

                  The Removed (R) compartment may consist of people who have recovered from COVID-19, died from COVID-19, or entirely isolated themselves from others, so that they cannot spread COVID-19 at all.

              The equations for the SEIR model are below. Use these, along with the Python code block, to answer the questions that follow.  
            </p>
            <p>
              For questions 2, 3, and possibly 4, first <em>imagine how changes to initial population values or parameter values can change outcomes in the model</em>. That is, truly think through this in your mind, and write down your thoughts, before proceeding with changes. For reference, the values in the original model are based very loosely on Lombardy, Italy, in early 2020. The total population was approximately ten million. The value of <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> was estimated to be <m>2.6-3.3</m>, and <m>\kappa</m> is estimated at about <m>1/6.5</m>.<fn>These estimates come from the paper <q>The early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Lombardy, Italy</q> by many researchers, published in the journal <em>Epidemics</em> in December 2021.</fn> The value of <m>\gamma</m> is <m>1/14</m>, indicating an average of two weeks of being infectious. This is based on many reports suggesting that most people were infectious for one to two weeks, but that some people were infectious for much longer. There was vast variation on how early COVID-19 affected people, which is part of the reason we need to consider changes and updates to models.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, try your changes in Python, creating before-and-after graphs. The code block includes sections titled <q>original model</q> and <q>your changes to the model</q>: scroll through to the <q>your changes to the model</q> version to make updates. Then go to the <q>plotting commands</q> section to choose the compartments for which you would like to show graphs; the default is to show I(t) for both the original and updated versions. Notice that if you were to show all four compartments, before and after, there would be eight total curves, which can be complicated for a reader to understand. Instead, prioritize the graphs that best illustrate your findings, probably showing no more than two or four total graphs at a time.

        <p>
          Suppose you have data to compare against your model. Which set of parameters is best? We start by revisiting the type of graph and data we saw with our (relatively simple) early-semester zombie models. Read through the following and make sure you understand what is happening in each command.

            One way to compare data with a graph is by computing the Residual Sum of Squares. (There will be an explanation during class time.) Within a single model, this is a good option. Read the code block below to see how we can do this in Python.

          Now try computing RSS using the influenza prevalence data. The data are already written into the code block below. Time 0 is the same as October 6.

        <p>
          Notice in the line <c>RSS = RSS + (I_prevalence_data[x] - sol[0 + 10 * x, 1])**2</c> that instead of writing <c>sol[0 + 10 * x, 0]</c> we write <c>sol[0 + 10 * x, 1]</c>. Changing the <c>0</c> to a <c>1</c> tells Python to use the next column of model values from the array of S, I, and R values, that is, to use column 1 of Infectious values rather than column 0 of Susceptible values. It is important to choose the correct column of model values when comparing with data values.

This code can also be used as a template for producing eigenvalues when the Next Generation Method produces a <m>3\times 3</m> matrix. Comparing this code with the previous code may help show how similar the code is when computing the Next Generation matrix for different models, as well as showing what to change for a different model.

            In this example, we assume that after a zombie infects a human, there is a <em>one-day incubation period</em>, meaning a one-day delay, before the human becomes a zombie. While the Zombie Game App can help generate data for such an outbreak, it does not have a direct way to incorporate the incubation period. We must therefore restart the app repeatedly and keep track of our own data, as described below.
          </p>  
          <p>  
            Start in <url href="https://nelsong1997.github.io/zombie_game/">the app</url> by beginning a game in which Human Start Count is set equal to 49 and Zombie Start Count is set equal to 1. Click <q>start</q> and write down the resulting number of new infections on Day 1: these are all the humans infected by our starting zombie. For instance, suppose there are two new infections from the interactions on Day 0, as circled in <xref ref="fig-zombie-SEI-Day-1" />. Then on Day 1, there should be 47 humans, 2 incubating individuals, and 1 zombie. The app says there are three zombies, but in our interpretation, 2 are incubating individuals, and 1 is a zombie. 
          </p>
          <figure width="90%" xml:id="fig-zombie-SEI-Day-1">

          </figure>
          <p>
            We therefore click <q>restart</q> on the app, so that we can enter a Human Start Count of 47 and a Zombie Start Count of 1. We do not include the 2 incubating individuals, since they do not affect the number of new zombies generated from Day 1 interactions. With these settings, we run the app for one round, generating new Infectious individuals once again. An example of this is shown in <xref ref="fig-zombie-SEI-Day-2" />. 
          </p>
          <figure width="90%" xml:id="fig-zombie-SEI-Day-2">

          </figure>
          <p>
            The next step is where we begin to re-introduce the individuals who were infected on Day 0 but still incubating the zombie disease on Day 1. From <xref ref="fig-zombie-SEI-Day-2" /> we see that we should have 46 humans and 1 incubating individual on Day 2. We also have 3 zombies: the initial zombie, plus the 2 incubating individuals from Day 1. We therefore restart the model, entering a Human Start Count of 46 and a Zombie Start Count of 3. A possible outcome appears in <xref ref="fig-zombie-SEI-Day-3" />.

            </image>
          </figure>
          <p>
            From this step, we continue until the game has ended. It helps to generate a new table of data, keeping track of the numbers of each of the three types of individuals. This table can be on paper, in a spreadsheet, or in whatever other form you prefer. <xref ref="fig-zombie-SEI-Data" /> shows a sample of how the table might look.

            Ask yourself: what do you observe? Compare this simulation with simulations having no incubation period. Consider how many days the outbreak lasts. Make note of your observations, share your ideas with others, and consider the observations of other people trying this experiment. Try the experiment with a longer incubation period, such as 2, 3, or 4 days, and observe the ways these changes affect outcomes of the model.

          <title>Basic Reproduction Number</title>
          <p>
            The basic reproduction number is the average number of new infections caused by one infectious person in an otherwise entirely susceptible population. The symbol <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m>, pronounced <q>R zero</q> or <q>R nought</q>, represents the concept of the basic reproduction number, both in writing and in mathematical formulas.  (Defined in Chapter 5, with a very brief mention at the end of Chapter 4)

          <title>Compartmental Diagram</title>
          <p>
            A compartmental diagram is an image, typically consisting of labeled boxes and arrows, that visually represents the flow of individuals through a <em>compartmental model</em>. Examples include <xref ref="fig-SI-compartmental-diagram"/> and <xref ref="fig-SIR-compartmental-diagram"/>. (Chapter 4)

          <title>Compartmental Model</title>
          <p>
            A compartmental model is a style of mathematical model in which the subjects of the model are grouped into categories called <em>compartments</em>. Such a model follows the overall outcomes for each compartment, but does not typically track the outcomes of smaller groups such as individuals. The compartmental models in this text use differential equations to demonstrate the interactions and rates governing how many individuals move from one group to another at specific points in time.  As one example of a compartmental model, an SIR model consists of three compartments: S, I, and R. Most often in this text, compartment S represents Susceptible individuals, compartment I represents Infectious individuals, and compartment R represents Removed individuals. (Chapter 4)
          </p>
        </gi>

        

        <gi>
          <title>Compartments</title>
          <p>
            In most models within this text, individuals are placed into categories called compartments. The individuals can typically move out of some compartments and into others, and the differential equations in compartmental models are sets of rules for the ways in which individuals are able to make such moves between compartments.  (Chapter 4)
          </p>
        </gi>

        <gi>
          <title>Continuous</title>
          <p>
            We tend to think of real-world time as continuous, meaning time does not keep stopping and starting. The compartmental models we use in most of this book show continuous time. While this sense of time matches the real world, we need to think about how to reconcile it with data sets, which typically involve discrete time steps, such as days or weeks.  (Chapter 2)
          </p>
        </gi>


        <gi>
          <title>Discrete</title>
          <p>
            We can think of time as discrete when we describe it as separate steps, such as Day 0, Day 1, or Day 2. Many data sets we work with report data in discrete time steps, such as by day or by week. We need to think through how to reconcile discrete data sets with the continuous models we most often use in this text. (Chapter 2)

          <title>Effective Reproduction Number</title>
          <p>
            The effective reproduction number is the average number of new infections caused by one infectious person in a population that is not entirely susceptible. The most common reason for a population to not be entirely susceptible is when some of the people have some form of immunity. Reasons for immunity may include vaccination and/or some of the people in the population previously having the disease being studied. The symbol <m>\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}}</m> represents the effective reproduction number. (Chapter 6)

        <gi>
          <title>Effectiveness</title>
          <p>
            A measure of how many people within a population of vaccinated individuals get a disease, compared with how many people within a comparable population of unvaccinated individuals get the same disease, <em>in real-world conditions</em>. For instance, if after a vaccine has been released to the public <m>90\%</m> fewer vaccinated people get the virus than do those who are unvaccinated, then the vaccine is said to have an effectiveness of <m>90\%</m>. (Chapter 6)
          </p>
        </gi>
        

        <gi>
          <title>Efficacy</title>
          <p>
            A measure of how many people within a population of vaccinated individuals get a disease, compared with how many people within a comparable population of unvaccinated individuals get the same disease, <em>in a clinical trial</em>. For instance, if in trials <m>70\%</m> fewer people in the vaccinated group get a virus than do those in the unvaccinated group, then the vaccine is said to have an efficacy of <m>70\%</m>.

          <title>Graphical Solution</title>
          <p>
            A graphical solution to a differential equation, or system of differential equations, is a curve or curves showing the behavior of the differential equation(s), based on specific parameter values and initial conditions. When parameter values change, or when initial conditions change, the graphical solution typically changes as well. A graphical solution is often called a <em>solution</em>, and readers should use context to know whether the word <em>solution</em> refers to a graphical solution, a numerical solution, or a formula. (Chapter 3)
          </p>
        </gi>

        
        <gi>
          <title>Initial Conditions</title>
          <p>
            Initial conditions are the starting values of the dependent variables in differential equations. Within this text, our dependent variables are typically populations such as <m>S(t)</m> or <m>I(t)</m>, and the start of solutions is usually the time <m>t=0</m>. This means the initial conditions are the values <m>S(0)</m> and <m>I(0)</m>. Initial conditions are used when computing a numerical solution: the numerical solution begins with the initial conditions and then <q>steps through</q> time, computing the later values of each dependent variable using both the earlier values and the information in the differential equations about how each dependent variable changes. (Chapter 3)

          <title>Mathematical Modeling</title>
          <p>
            Mathematical modeling is a process by which we represent real-world dynamics using mathematical formulas. In this text, we typically use differential equations in our models. The process of mathematical modeling can require many steps, such as choosing which equations to use, comparing the results of a model with data, updating a model as needed to respond to different goals, and considering multiple models to best answer the questions we are asking. (Chapter 7)
          </p>
        </gi>


        <gi>
          <title>Numerical Solution</title>
          <p>
            A numerical solution to a differential equation, or system of differential equations, is a set of lists of numbers that result from approximating the outcome of the differential equation(s), given specific parameter values and initial conditions. When parameter values change, or when initial conditions change, the numerical solution typically changes as well. The lists of numbers for an SIR model, for instance, typically show the values of <m>S(t)</m>, <m>I(t)</m>, and <m>R(t)</m> at many values of time <m>t</m> within the range of time values of interest. We may print some or all of the values in the lists, or we may use graphing to present the information in the lists. A numerical solution is often called a <em>solution</em>, and readers should use context to know whether the word <em>solution</em> refers to a graphical solution, a numerical solution, or a formula. (Chapter 3)
          </p>
        </gi>


        
        <gi>
          <title>Parameters</title>
          <p>
            Parameters in a model are numbers, determined using biological information, that represent some aspect of how a disease progresses. In this text, most parameters are shown as Greek letters, such as <m>\beta</m> or <m>\gamma</m>. A few parameters in this text represent percentages, such as the percentage of a population that is vaccinated against a disease, and these parameters are typically represented by lowercase letters such as <m>p</m> or <m>q</m>. Parameters are different than variables: the variables in our models are typically the independent variable <m>t</m> for time, and dependent variables such as <m>S</m>, <m>I</m>, <m>R</m>, and others, for populations.  (Chapter 4)
          </p>
        </gi>

        
        
        <gi>
          <title>Rate</title>
          <p>
            A rate is, in general, a ratio between two different things. In this text, rates are parameters having units <m>1/\text{time}</m>. In a model, the rate is typically multiplied by a population such as <m>I</m> or <m>R</m> to show the flow of that population out of one compartment and into another compartment. (Chapter 4)
          </p>
        </gi>

        
        <gi>
          <title>Sign Analysis</title>
          <p>
            The word <q>sign</q> in sign analysis refers to whether terms in differential equations are positive (<m>+</m>), negative (<m>-</m>), or zero (<m>0</m>). In sign analysis, we use these signs to build understanding of the differential equation. Often, our goal is to learn whether the solution to the differential equation is rising, falling, or level at some time <m>t</m>. This understanding may help us identify which solution curve goes with which differential equation, may show when a disease starts with an outbreak or can never experience an outbreak, and may indicate many other outcomes of models. Sign analysis is powerful because it depends only on the signs of terms, without forcing us to rely on detailed data sets that may not always be available. (Chapter 5)

          <title>SI Model</title>
          <p>
            An SI model is a compartmental model having two compartments, labeled S and I. Most often in this text, S stands for <em>Susceptible</em> and I stands for <em>Infectious</em>, though the compartments can have other interpretations. The letters S and I are each pronounced when we say <q>SI model</q>: <q>Ess</q> <q>Eye</q> model. (Chapter 2)

          <title>SEIR Model</title>
          <p>
            An SEIR model is a compartmental model having four compartments, labeled S, E, I, and R. Most often in this text, S stands for <em>Susceptible</em>, E stands for <em>Exposed-and-incubating</em>, I stands for <em>Infectious</em>, and R stands for <em>Removed</em>, though the compartments can have other interpretations. The letters S, E, I, and R are each pronounced when we say <q>SEIR model</q>: <q>Ess</q> <q>Eee</q> <q>Eye</q> <q>Arr</q> model. (Chapter 6)

          <title>SIR Model</title>
          <p>
            An SIR model is a compartmental model having three compartments, labeled S, I, and R. Most often in this text, S stands for <em>Susceptible</em>, I stands for <em>Infectious</em>, and R stands for <em>Removed</em>, though the compartments can have other interpretations. The letters S, I, and R are each pronounced when we say <q>SIR model</q>: <q>Ess</q> <q>Eye</q> <q>Arr</q> model. (Chapter 4)

          <title>Total Population</title>
          <p>
            The total population of a compartmental model is the sum of the populations in each compartment. We typically use the variable <m>N</m> to refer to total population, and we write <m>N(t)</m> to mean total population at time <m>t</m>. (Chapter 5)
