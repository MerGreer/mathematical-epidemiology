      <p>
        At this point, we have studied compartmental models, mathematical analysis of models, and multiple variations to those models. You can now develop models for many different kinds of infectious disease outbreak and for a variety of public health interventions that can be used to stop, slow, or reduce the size of the outbreak.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, we begin a three-chapter foray into comparing models with data. In this chapter, we start with a typical data set that shows how many new cases occur per day (or per week, month, or other time period), and we restructure those numbers into a set of numbers that more meaningfully compares with the models we write. <xref ref="ch-residual-sum-of-squares-improving-a-models-fit-to-data"/> introduces Python code for fitting a model to a data set, adjusting parameters within the model to improve the fit. Then, in <xref ref="ch-akaike-information-criterion-comparing-different-models"/>, we compare multiple models for the same outbreak.
      </p>

      <p>
        Begin in <xref ref="expl-activity-influenza-data"/> by investigating data sets generated by the Zombie Game App. We will use different columns of data from this app to help us think about how typical real-world disease data sets can compare with the kinds of compartmental models we have been studying.

        <title>Comparing Data: New Zombies vs. All Current Zombies</title>
        <introduction>
          <p>
            We return to the Zombie Game App, using the <em>Zombie Mortality</em> feature in a similar way to what we first saw in <xref ref="expl-activity-varying-the-human-zombie-game"/>. This time, our goal is to distinguish between the data for <em># Zombies</em> and the data for <em>New Infections</em>.

            <p>
              The data table below comes from the Zombie Game App. This table results from a simulation in which zombies are designated as mortal, with a <q>lifespan</q> (if zombies can be said to have a lifespan) of two days.

            <p>
              On paper or in a spreadsheet: create a plot with <em>Round #</em> on the horizontal axis and <em># Zombies</em> on the vertical axis. Separately, create a plot with <em>Round #</em> on the horizontal axis and <em>New Infections</em> on the vertical axis.
            </p>
            <p>
              Make at least three observations, comparing and contrasting your plots.

          <statement>
            <p>
              Next, open the <url href="https://nelsong1997.github.io/zombie_game/">Zombie Game App</url> to generate your own data. Within the app, check the box labeled <em>Zombie Mortality</em>, located under the heading <em>Other Options</em>. Once you do so, you can select the  <em>Zombie Lifespan (days)</em>. Then run the game and make note of your resulting data table. Again, graph the data for <em># Zombies</em> and for <em>New Infections</em>, as you did in part (a).
            </p>
            <p>
              Which of your observations from part (a) remain true? If any change, which observations change, and in what ways do they change?

        <task>

            <p>
              When running the <url href="https://nelsong1997.github.io/zombie_game/">Zombie Game App</url> in part (b), you may also choose to change the initial <em>Human Start Count</em> to make it more likely for Humans to win the game. Write out at least three different combinations of <em>Zombie Lifespan (days)</em> and <em>Human Start Count</em> that you used and found that Humans won the game.         
            </p>
            <p>
              In general: does <em>increasing</em> or <em>decreasing</em> the Human Start Count make it more likely for Humans to win? What mathematical epidemiology quantity that we have studied provides insight into the answer to this question?

      <title>Incidence and Prevalence</title>
      
      <p>
        When studying mathematical epidemiology, it helps to distinguish between the epidemiological terms <em>incidence</em> and <em>prevalence</em>. <term>Incidence</term> is a measure of new cases within a specified time unit, such as new cases per day or new cases per week. <term>Prevalence</term> is the total number of active cases at a given time, which means that prevalence includes both new cases and already-existing cases.
      </p>

      <activity xml:id="activity-incidence-prevalence">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Below is a graph created from a data set generated by the Zombie Game App. This data set was created using the same settings as the data in <xref ref="fig-human-zombie-SIR-sample-data-table"/>, that is, zombies are mortal and have a two-day <q>lifespan</q>. The specific data values here are different than those in <xref ref="fig-human-zombie-SIR-sample-data-table"/>.

          <p>
            Spend some time thinking about the graph in <xref ref="fig-zombies-incidence-prevalence"/> while also thinking about your work in <xref ref="expl-activity-influenza-data"/>. Then respond to the following prompts.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                First, simply list observations you had while comparing <xref ref="fig-zombies-incidence-prevalence"/> with what you did in <xref ref="expl-activity-influenza-data"/>. List at least three observations.
              </p>     
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Next, read carefully the descriptions for <em>incidence</em> and <em>prevalence</em> at the start of <xref ref="sec-incidence-and-prevalence"/>. Which of the curves in <xref ref="fig-zombies-incidence-prevalence"/> seems to you to better represent incidence? And which curve seems to better represent prevalence? Explain your reasoning.
              </p>     
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Now compare <xref ref="fig-zombies-incidence-prevalence"/> with graphs you have seen for SIR models, when we plot solution curves for <m>S(t)</m>, <m>I(t)</m>, and <m>R(t)</m>. Given curves for data on New Infections vs. time, and data on # Zombies vs. time, which seems better for comparing with the <m>I(t)</m> curve we would generate in a model of an outbreak?
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
                     
        </statement>
        <answer>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                There can be many kinds of observations. Be thoughtful; be creative; think broadly. 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The New Infections curve tells us the number of new cases per round, and this closely mirrors the wording in the definition of incidence. The # Zombies curve tells us the total number of active zombies per round, and this wording is very similar to wording in the definition of prevalence.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The <m>I(t)</m> curve typically describes all active infections at a given time <m>t</m>. This compares best with the data for # Zombies vs. time.   
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
