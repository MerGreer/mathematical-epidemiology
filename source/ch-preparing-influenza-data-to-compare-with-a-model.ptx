      <p>
        At this point, we have studied compartmental models, mathematical analysis of models, and multiple variations to those models. You can now develop models for many different kinds of infectious disease outbreak and for a variety of public health interventions that can be used to stop, slow, or reduce the size of the outbreak.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, we begin a three-chapter foray into comparing models with data. In this chapter, we start with a typical data set that shows how many new cases occur per day (or per week, month, or other time period), and we restructure those numbers into a set of numbers that more meaningfully compares with the models we write. <xref ref="ch-residual-sum-of-squares-improving-a-models-fit-to-data"/> introduces Python code for fitting a model to a data set, adjusting parameters within the model to improve the fit. Then, in <xref ref="ch-akaike-information-criterion-comparing-different-models"/>, we compare multiple models for the same outbreak.
      </p>

      <p>
        Begin in <xref ref="expl-activity-influenza-data"/> by investigating data sets generated by the Zombie Game App. We will use different columns of data from this app to help us think about how typical real-world disease data sets can compare with the kinds of compartmental models we have been studying.

            We return to the Zombie Game App, using the <em>Zombie Mortality</em> feature in a similar way to what we first saw in <xref ref="expl-activity-varying-the-human-zombie-game"/>. This time, our goal is to distinguish between the data for <em># Zombies</em> and the data for <em>New Infections</em>.

              The data table below comes from the Zombie Game App. This table results from a simulation in which zombies are designated as mortal, with a <q>lifespan</q> (if zombies can be said to have a lifespan) of two days. Once a zombie surpasses its lifespan, it moves to the <em>Removed</em> category, meaning it no longer appears on the hex grid and can no longer infect humans.

              Next, open the <url href="https://nelsong1997.github.io/zombie_game/">Zombie Game App</url> to generate your own data. Within the app, check the box labeled <em>Zombie Mortality</em>, located under the heading <em>Other Options</em>. Once you do so, you can select the  <em>Zombie Lifespan (days)</em>. Then run the game and make note of your resulting data table. Again, graph the data for <em># Zombies</em> and for <em>New Infections</em>, as you did in part (a).
            </p>
            <p>

              When running the <url href="https://nelsong1997.github.io/zombie_game/">Zombie Game App</url> in part (b), you may also choose to change the default <em>Human Start Count</em> to make it more likely for Humans to win the game. Write out at least three different combinations of <em>Zombie Lifespan (days)</em> and <em>Human Start Count</em> that you used and found that Humans won the game. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, investigate the question: when keeping <em>Zombie Lifespan (days)</em> the same, does <em>increasing</em> or <em>decreasing</em> the Human Start Count make it more likely for Humans to win? Support your response using evidence you generate from the Zombie Game App.

      <title>Incidence and Prevalence</title>
      
      <p>
        When studying mathematical epidemiology, it helps to distinguish between the epidemiological terms <em>incidence</em> and <em>prevalence</em>. <term>Incidence</term> is a measure of new cases within a specified time unit, such as new cases per day or new cases per week. <term>Prevalence</term> is the total number of active cases at a given time, which means that prevalence includes both new cases and already-existing cases. <xref ref="activity-incidence-prevalence"/> provides practice with these terms, as they relate to data from the Zombie Game App and to solution curves from SIR models.

            Below is a graph created from a data set generated by the Zombie Game App. This data set was created using the same app settings as the data in <xref ref="fig-human-zombie-SIR-sample-data-table"/>, that is, zombies are mortal and have a two-day <q>lifespan</q>. The specific data values here are different than those in <xref ref="fig-human-zombie-SIR-sample-data-table"/>.

            Spend some time thinking about the graph in <xref ref="fig-zombies-incidence-prevalence"/> while also thinking about your work in <xref ref="expl-activity-influenza-data"/>. Then respond to the following prompts.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                First, simply list observations you had while comparing <xref ref="fig-zombies-incidence-prevalence"/> with what you did in <xref ref="expl-activity-influenza-data"/>. List at least three observations.
              </p>     
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Next, read carefully the descriptions for <em>incidence</em> and <em>prevalence</em> at the start of <xref ref="sec-incidence-and-prevalence"/>. Which of the curves in <xref ref="fig-zombies-incidence-prevalence"/> seems to you to better represent incidence? And which curve seems to better represent prevalence? Explain your reasoning.
              </p>     
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Now compare <xref ref="fig-zombies-incidence-prevalence"/> with graphs you have seen for SIR models, when we plot solution curves for <m>S(t)</m>, <m>I(t)</m>, and <m>R(t)</m>. 
                Which of the data plots in <xref ref="fig-zombies-incidence-prevalence"/> -- the New Infections plot, or the # Zombies plot -- seems better for comparing with the <m>I(t)</m> curve we would generate in an SIR model of an outbreak?
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
                     
        </statement>
        <answer>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                There can be many kinds of observations. Be thoughtful; be creative; think broadly. 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The New Infections curve tells us the number of new cases per round, and this closely mirrors the wording in the definition of incidence. The # Zombies curve tells us the total number of active zombies per round, and this wording is very similar to wording in the definition of prevalence.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The <m>I(t)</m> curve often describes all active infections at a given time <m>t</m>. This compares best with the data for # Zombies vs. time. (This is not a perfect comparison for every outbreak, as sometimes <m>I(t)</m> means a person is contagious but does not yet show symptoms. However, in the basic zombie game, where is a person is contagious exactly when they are a zombie, the <m>I(t)</m> curve is well matched with data for # Zombies.)
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          
        </answer>
      </activity>

      <p>
        It turns out that outbreak data typically take a format similar to the numbers shown in the <em>New Infections</em> column of data in the Zombie Game App. These numbers may be shared as a table of values, or in a graphical format, such as a histogram. In order to compare the number of new cases in an outbreak with the <m>I(t)</m> curve in an SIR model (or other compartmental model), we need to use what we know about the outbreak to convert the numbers of new cases into the number of people in the I compartment at each time step of the outbreak. This is our goal in <xref ref="sec-translating-a-typical-data-set-into-numbers-we-can-compare-with-a-model"/>.

        <title>Translating a Typical Data Set Into Numbers We Can Compare With a Model </title>

        <p>
          In the fall of 2009, Bates College experienced an outbreak of H1N1 influenza. The initiating event appeared to be Parents' and Families' Weekend, a time when relatives of students were all invited to campus for a weekend of events together. Shortly thereafter, the first confirmed cases of H1N1 appeared on campus. There were multiple initial infections, due to several students independently becoming infected after visitors came to campus. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Before the fall 2009 semester, college officials at Bates and elsewhere had been preparing for the newly emerged H1N1 influenza virus. While the specific influenza viruses that circulate each year differ somewhat from those that circulated in previous years, the 2009 H1N1 virus had distinct genetic differences from any influenza viruses that had ever been studied in humans. The <url href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/influenza-a-(h1n1)-outbreak">World Health Organization</url> and the <url href="https://www.cdc.gov/orr/responses/h1n1-influenza-pandemic.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</url> describe more about the differences on their websites. The novelty of the fall 2009 H1N1 virus led to heightened concern about large outbreaks and possible effects on people of all ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <xref ref="activity-h1n1-data-fall-2009"/> we work with real data collected during the Bates outbreak. Starting with this data set, which is shown in <xref ref="table-h1n1-fall-2009"/>, we think through how to convert data into numbers we can compare with an SIR model for the spread of H1N1 influenza.

              After the 2009 outbreak of H1N1 influenza virus on the Bates College campus, the Dean of Students and Student Health Services were kind enough to share their data on new infections among students. As is common with data sets for an outbreak: information that could identify specific individuals has been removed, and the data set takes the form of new case reports. The data set appears in <xref ref="table-h1n1-fall-2009"/>.

              Influenza moves quickly. The incubation period is short, often just two days or even shorter, and people can become contagious before showing symptoms.<fn>Two articles to support this are <q>2009 H1N1 Influenza</q> by Seth J. Sullivan, Robert M. Jacobson, Walter R. Dowdle, and Gregory A. Poland, published January 2010 in the <em>Mayo Clinic Proceedings</em>, and <q>Outbreak of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) at a New York City school</q> by Justin Lessler, Nicholas G. Reich, and Derek A. T. Cummings, published in 2009 in the New England Journal of Medicine.</fn> For this reason, we use an SIR model instead of an SEIR model. 
              There are multiple estimates for how long people remain contagious, with five days as a commonly provided number, though for some people the contagious period may be a little shorter or a few days longer. <fn>The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control includes the estimate of five days for adults and seven days for children on their web page <q>Questions and answers on the pandemic (H1N1) 2009</q>, last accessed 16 September 2024, available at <url href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/seasonal-influenza/2009-influenza-h1n1-faq" />.
              </fn>  
            </p>
            <p>
              Given this information about the incubation period and contagious period of H1N1, follow the steps below to convert the incidence data in <xref ref="table-h1n1-fall-2009"/> to prevalence numbers that can be compared with the I compartment of an SIR model.

                  Open <url href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M3-G-t22ibUqKmEOMhmeK99T0iKIWefUzI9G0jXjg0g/edit?usp=sharing">this publicly shared spreadsheet</url>  and make your own copy.

                <p>
                  Create a new column titled <q>Prevalence</q>. Compute the H1N1 prevalence for each day by supposing that once people are in the Infectious compartment, they remain Infectious for five days. This means, for instance, that the five initial cases from October 6 remain Infectious for October 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, but on October 11 they no longer are Infectious. 
                  You may notice that we are thinking of prevalence and the Infectious compartment as equivalent. This equivalence works well for influenza, as people become contagious very close to the time when they begin showing symptoms, and they stop being contagious approximately when they stop showing symptoms.

                  Extend the length of your <q>Prevalence</q> column so that it represents the full five days of contagion for all the New Cases Reported. This means adding extra rows at the bottom of the table.

                  Create a plot showing New Cases Reported on the vertical axis, with time on the horizontal axis. The horizontal axis in your chart should show the dates. On the same axes, create a plot showing Prevalence on the vertical axis, with time again on the horizontal axis.

                  To create this type of spreadsheet plot in Google Sheets, choose menu item <c>Insert</c>, then choose <c>Chart</c>, and then in the Chart Editor, select <c>Line chart</c>. The Chart Editor provides several ways to edit the chart.

                  Discuss with your group: how does each of the two plots compare (or not) with typical <m>I(t)</m> curves in outbreaks? Make three or more observations.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Bonus spreadsheet work, if time permits: go back to the <q>Prevalence</q> column you created. If you have not yet used spreadsheet formulas to determine the column entries, try to do so. Formulas let you refer to other cells in the spreadsheet, rather than re-typing their numbers every time you re-use the same numbers.

                  <description>This is a graph showing two plots of the H1N1 outbreak at Bates in 2009. The first is new cases vs. time. The second is prevalence vs. time.</description>

            <p>
              <em>Observations.</em> Observations about the plots may be wide-ranging: this is open-ended. One possible observation is that the New Cases Reported plot has two mini-peaks, compared with the single, more-obvious, peak in the Prevalence plot. 
              Another possible observation is to compare with a typical <m>I(t)</m> curve and notice that the Prevalence plot is more similar in appearance than the New Cases Reported plot. 
              Another possible observation is that the Prevalence plot includes higher numbers of students than the New Cases Reported plot, which makes sense, since we count students across each day they are sick, rather than just once when they report that they are sick. 
              These are a few common observations, but to emphasize: there are many more possible. Keep seeking more.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Spreadsheet Formulas.</em> For the Prevalence column, rather than compute values ourself, we can let the spreadsheet do this for us. If you copied the shared spreadsheet, the data values begin in row 5, and Prevalence appears in column D. 
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  To compute prevalence on October 6, rather than type in the number 5, you can type in <c>=C5</c> to bring in the value 5 from cell C5.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  In cell D6, for prevalence on October 7, rather than add 5 and 8 to obtain 13, you can type <c>=C5+C6</c>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Similarly, for cell D7, have the spreadsheet add the numbers for cells C5, C6, and C7. For cell D8, have the spreadsheet add the numbers for cells C5, C6, C7, and C8.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Here (along with the next step) is where we start to see how a spreadsheet can automate work for us. For cell D9, use the <c>sum</c> function. Type <c>=sum(C5:C9)</c> to have the spreadsheet add the numbers for all the cells from C5 to C9, that is: C5, C6, C7, C8, and C9.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Now we can stop typing so much. Copy what you typed in cell D9, and paste it into the rest of your prevalence cells in column D. To match the table in <xref ref="table-h1n1-fall-2009-including-prevalence"/>, this means pasting into cells D10 through D24. 
                  Notice that the spreadsheet does not always add the values in cells C5 through C9: instead, the spreadsheet adds the values in the five cells that are in similar locations, <em>relative to the prevalence cell being computed</em>. To see which cells are being added to obtain each prevalence value, click on that cell in the prevalence column and view the formula.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul> 
            <p>
              There is more than one way to compute the formulas for the Prevalence column. If you used spreadsheet formulas but found a different approach (such as starting with the prevalence value the day before, adding the new cases for that day, and subtracting the cases from five days earlier), and if your approach resulted in the same values, then well done!

        <p>
          <xref ref="activity-h1n1-data-fall-2009"/> is lengthy! There is a lot to work through. Mathematically, we are primarily adding numbers, but we must make sure to do so in a way that correctly represents real data from a real outbreak. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Completing <xref ref="activity-h1n1-data-fall-2009"/> is adequate for comparing influenza prevalence data with the <m>I(t)</m> compartment of a model. However, at times we may want to compare another compartment of a model to the appropriate data. In (name activity), continue your work from <xref ref="activity-h1n1-data-fall-2009"/> to convert the Bates 2009 H1N1 data set into values that can be compared with the <m>S(t)</m> and <m>R(t)</m> compartments.
