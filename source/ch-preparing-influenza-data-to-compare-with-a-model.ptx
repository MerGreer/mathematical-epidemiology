      <p>
        At this point, we have studied compartmental models, mathematical analysis of models, and multiple variations to those models. You should now feel that you can develop a model for many different kinds of infectious disease outbreak and for a variety of public health interventions that can be used to stop, slow, or reduce the size of the outbreak.
      </p>

      <p>
        We now begin a three-chapter foray into comparing models with data. In this chapter, we start with a typical data set that shows how many new cases occur per day (or per week, month, or other time period), and we restructure those numbers into a set of numbers that more meaningfully compares with the models we write. <xref ref="ch-residual-sum-of-squares-improving-a-models-fit-to-data"/> introduces Python code for fitting a model to a data set, adjusting parameters within the model to improve the fit. Then, in <xref ref="ch-akaike-information-criterion-comparing-different-models"/>, we compare multiple models for the same outbreak.

      <title>Starter Example Comparing Data with a Model: Zombie Data</title>
      <!-- <p>Use Bates flu data. Discuss converting from New Cases to S, I, R and possibly other compartments. Also discuss different time scales (here or elsewhere): converting data and parameters between days, weeks, months, years.</p> -->
      <p>
        Suppose you have data to compare against your model. Which set of parameters is best? We start by revisiting the type of graph and data we saw with our (relatively simple) early-semester zombie models. Read through the following and make sure you understand what is happening in each command.

        <title>Using RSS</title>

        <p>
          One way to compare data with a graph is by computing the Residual Sum of Squares. (There will be an explanation during class time.) Within a single model, this is a good option. Read the code block below to see how we can do this in Python.

      <title>Influenza Data and RSS</title>

      <p>
        Now try computing RSS using the influenza prevalence data. The data are already written into the code block below. Time 0 is the same as October 6.
      </p>

      <p>
        Notice in the line <c>RSS = RSS + (I_prevalence_data[x] - sol[0 + 10 * x, 1])**2</c> that instead of writing <c>sol[0 + 10 * x, 0]</c> we write <c>sol[0 + 10 * x, 1]</c>. Changing the <c>0</c> to a <c>1</c> tells Python to use the next column of model values from the array of S, I, and R values, that is, to use column 1 of Infectious values rather than column 0 of Susceptible values. It is important to choose the correct column of model values when comparing with data values.
