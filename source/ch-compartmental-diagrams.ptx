      In <xref ref="ch-zombies-can-math-help" /> we simulated a simple outbreak. This outbreak can be modeled using the <em>system of ordinary differential equations</em> appearing in <xref ref="eq-S-in-SImodel" /> and <xref ref="eq-I-in-SImodel" />. Here is the system again:  
    </p>

    <md>
      <mrow>\frac{dS}{dt} \amp = -\beta S I </mrow>
      <mrow>\frac{dI}{dt} \amp = \beta S I. </mrow>
    </md>

    <p>
      This style of model is called a <term>compartmental model</term> because the individuals in our model are designated by categories called <term>compartments</term>; in this case, the compartments are <q>Susceptibles</q> and <q>Infectious</q>. In <xref ref="ch-zombies-can-math-help" /> we made calculus-based observations of the differential equations in this model. We can draw the dynamics of the model in a <term>compartmental diagram</term>, as shown in <xref ref="fig-SI-compartmental-diagram" />.

      In this text, we regularly represent the dynamics of an outbreak using both compartmental model drawings and systems of differential equations. When we are careful in how we draw our compartmental diagrams, we can use these diagrams interchangeably with their corresponding systems of differential equations. In this chapter, we learn the vocabulary of compartmental models, as well as ways to draw compartmental diagrams so they clearly and completely represent the information contained in their corresponding systems of differential equations.
    </p>
    <p>
      We begin in <xref ref="expl-activity-varying-the-human-zombie-game"/> by trying a different version of the human<ndash/>zombie game. We then ask you to use the intuition you are building to think through how the compartmental diagram should look for this human<ndash/>zombie game variation. After that, we discuss more details about compartmental diagrams. <em>You are strongly encouraged to try to build your own compartmental diagram before moving on to the text's discussion of the details.</em>

      <title>Varying the Human<ndash />Zombie Game</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          In the original <url href="https://nelsong1997.github.io/zombie_game/">Zombie Game App,</url> once an individual becomes a zombie, they are always a zombie. This means that no one leaves the Infectious compartment. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose, instead, that zombies do not last forever. Instead, after some number of days, the zombies die (again), or in other words, the zombies become inactive. The number of days they remain Infectious before becoming inactive can be stated in the app.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            <em>Before trying this scenario in the app</em>, think through how zombie death, and different zombie lifespans, would change the outcomes of the simulation. In particular, think carefully about these questions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                What do you <em>expect</em> will happen if Zombies die, that is, they become inactive and unable to spread infection? Whether you feel very certain, or somewhat uncertain, articulate some outcomes that you think will occur with this game variation.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                How might your expected outcomes differ from those in the original model?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Outcomes might be measured by the table of data, by the graphs, by the timing of how infection spreads, by the numbers of survivors, or in other ways. For each of your expectations about how the outcomes may change, what support can you show for why this expectation makes sense?
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This exercise is not about right or wrong ideas, but instead is about building hypotheses, comparing the hypotheses with data, and developing deeper understanding of what the model shows.

    <section xml:id="sec-compartmental-diagrams-vocabulary-and-comments">
      <title>Compartmental Diagrams: Vocabulary and Comments</title>

      <p>
        In this section, we give a general description of compartmental diagrams. As you read, check in with the intuition you have been building: do these ideas fit with your understanding so far? Soon, in <xref ref="sec-from-zombie-game-variation-to-compartmental-diagram"/>, we will connect these general ideas about compartmental diagrams with the specific model you constructed in <xref ref="expl-activity-varying-the-human-zombie-game"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A compartmental diagram is made up of boxes and arrows, each labeled to show what it represents. The boxes are called <term>compartments</term> and represent mutually distinct groups of individuals. The arrows indicate the possible ways that individuals can relocate from one compartment to another.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we say <q>mutually distinct</q>, we mean that at any moment in time, an individual is in exactly one compartment: no more, no fewer. This means our entire population is fully accounted for at all times because everyone appears in some compartment. We also notice that we cannot double-count individuals, as they cannot be in more than one compartment at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because our models use continuous time and differential equations, we will sometimes compute non-integer values for the number of individuals in some compartments. We should think through this carefully. If, for instance, we find that at some time we have 13.6 Susceptibles and 36.4 Infectious, we are not saying that we have 13 Susceptibles, plus 36 Infectious, plus one individual who is split up to be 60% Susceptible and 40% Infectious. Instead, the differential equation model is telling us on average what happens, across many possible simulations or many possible outcomes. In computing an <em>on average</em> outcome, non-integer values are possible. If we wish to refer to actual numbers of people, we can round to the nearest integer, or use language that reflects the <em>on average</em> meaning of our model.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we use a compartmental diagram, we should carefully define and describe all our terms. The definitions and descriptions may change in different models, so we should not assume that <m>t</m>, <m>S</m>, <m>I</m>, or other variables always have the same meaning. Time, <m>t</m>, may be measured in days, weeks, or some other unit, and we should indicate the unit. Here are possible descriptions for <m>S</m> and <m>I</m> based on the human<ndash />zombie game in <xref ref="ch-zombies-can-math-help" />: <m>S</m> stands for the Susceptible population, meaning people who do not have the zombie disease yet but could become ill with this disease, and <m>I</m> stands for the Infectious population, meaning individuals who are currently contagious and currently showing symptoms of the zombie disease. In other outbreaks, and therefore in other models, these descriptions may change. As just one example, <m>I</m> in a different model may refer to individuals who are Infectious in the sense that they are contagious, but they may or may not be showing symptoms. Modelers should fully state the specific definitions of <m>S</m>, <m>I</m>, or other populations, in their models. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The term <m>\beta SI</m> indicates flow from <m>S</m> to <m>I</m>. This term indicates that the flow depends on both the population <m>S</m> and the population <m>I</m>. When either population is very small, flow is relatively small. When both populations are relatively large, their product is large and therefore flow is relatively large. This sort of term is called a <em>mass action</em> term, from the Law of Mass Action in chemistry. The idea of mass action is just one way to model flow from one compartment to another; we will study other formulas for flow.
      </p>

      <p>
        The letters <m>S</m>, <m>I</m>, and <m>t</m> are variables in the model. The Greek letter <m>\beta</m> is a parameter. We use the following conventions for letters in most of the models we study: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Time is denoted as the <em>lowercase letter</em> <m>t</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We use <em>capital letters</em> such as <m>S</m> and <m>I</m> to indicate populations of people, which are typically functions of time, so that <m>S=S(t)</m>, <m>I=I(t)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Greek letters</em> such as <m>\beta</m> represent some aspect of how a disease progresses and are called <term>parameters</term>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A parameter may seem to behave a bit like a variable, since it can take on different values. However, parameters play a different role than variables in our models. In a given simulation, <em>we use biological information to set all parameter values</em>. 
        By contrast, we choose only the initial values of our variables, that is, the values when <m>t=0</m>, and then the simulation reveals the values of each variable at later points in time. 
        For instance, in the human<ndash />zombie example, we start at <m>t=0</m> with 49 humans and 1 zombie. Writing this in mathematical terms: <m>S(0)=49</m> and <m>I(0)=1</m>. 
        After <m>t=0</m>, the populations of Susceptibles and Infectious depend on the outcome of the simulation. Even the length of time for the simulation depends on how long it takes the Infectious zombies to convert all the Susceptible humans.
      </p>
      <p>
        As first mentioned in <xref ref="ch-zombies-can-math-help"/>, the values of parameters and population variables can be positive, or sometimes <m>0</m>, but should never be negative. Variables referring to populations, such as <m>S</m> and <m>I</m>, indicate the number of people in a compartment, and therefore it does not make sense for them to be negative, as this would indicate a negative number of people. A variable referring to time should almost always be positive, as we typically think of a disease starting at time <m>t=0</m>. Parameters describe a variety of things, from the transmission parameter <m>\beta</m> we have seen, to parameters we will start learning about in <xref ref="sec-from-zombie-game-variation-to-compartmental-diagram"/> and <xref ref="sec-estimating-gamma-and-other-rates"/> that relate to time spent in a compartment, to parameters indicating percentages, such as percentage of a population that is vaccinated. In all cases, only non-negative numbers are biologically meaningful. An advantage of positive parameters and variables is that we <em>see</em> in our model whether a term is positive or negative in an equation: if we see a negative sign, the term is negative; otherwise, that term is positive. This is in contrast to more general mathematical equations in other applications: mathematical epidemiology makes positives and negatives completely apparent.

      <title>From Zombie Game Variation to Compartmental Diagram</title>
      
      <p>
        The Zombie Game variation in <xref ref="expl-activity-varying-the-human-zombie-game" /> introduces a new category of individuals, beyond Susceptibles and Infectious. This new category corresponds to a new compartment, compared with <xref ref="fig-SI-compartmental-diagram" />, in the model's compartmental diagram. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When zombies die, they leave the Infectious compartment and can no longer infect the Susceptibles. It is typical to represent these dynamics by introducing a Removed (R) compartment for the individuals who were zombies but have then become inactive. Our model then includes S, I, and R compartments, so we call it an <term>SIR model</term>.<fn>We typically say each of the letters in SIR when naming this model aloud. That is, we refer to the <q>S</q> <q>I</q> <q>R</q> model, not the <q>sir</q> model.</fn>  A compartmental diagram representing the dynamics of this SIR model appears in <xref ref="fig-SIR-compartmental-diagram" />.

    <p>
      In this diagram, we include the S and I compartments used previously, while also allowing the Infectious zombies to leave the I compartment and enter the R compartment, where they stay for the rest of the simulation. The mathematical formula for movement from I to R is <m>\gamma I</m>. The parameter <m>\gamma</m> (the Greek letter <em>gamma</em>) represents the rate at which individuals leave <m>I</m> and enter <m>R</m>. Larger values of <m>\gamma</m>, for instance, mean that zombies become inactive more rapidly than with smaller values of <m>\gamma</m>. This formula indicates that neither Susceptibles nor Removed individuals influence movement from I to R: instead, only the number of Infectious people, and a rate based on how long they remain zombies, determine this movement between compartments.

              It should be true that individuals are in exactly one compartment at a time, but with all claims such as this, you should convince yourself or else ask questions about it. It should also be true that individuals cannot progress in any order other than what the compartmental diagram shows. However, in some simulations, some individuals may not leave compartment S. By contrast, with <xref ref="expl-activity-zombie-game"/> and the SI model, all individuals progress from the S compartment to the I compartment.

      (MOVE THIS TO CHAPTER 13!!! OR ELSEWHERE....) For the <q>Introduce an incubation period</q> variation in (subsec no longer exists), we do not include the compartment R, but we do include a compartment for individuals who are in an incubation period. A typical way to label this compartment is E, which stands for Exposed. (Notice that we already are using I for Infectious, so we cannot use I for Incubating.) The word Exposed may be misleading, since in daily life, we tend to think of being exposed to illness as meaning that a person may or may not become sick. Instead, in our model, the Exposed individuals will definitely become sick. For this reason, in this text, we will refer to the E compartment as <term>Exposed-and-incubating</term>. This model then includes the S, E, and I compartments, so we call it SEI. A compartmental diagram representing the dynamics of this simulation appears in <xref ref="fig-SEI-compartmental-diagram" />.

    <!-- <p>
      In this diagram, after a human comes into contact with a zombie, the human moves out of the Susceptible compartment and into the Exposed-and-incubating compartment. The formula on the arrow from S to E is <m>\beta S I</m>, since the movement out of S depends on an interaction between S and I. The mathematical formula for movement from E to I is <m>\kappa E</m>. The parameter <m>\kappa </m> (the Greek letter <em>kappa</em>) represents the rate at which individuals leave E and enter I.

        Consider an SIR model as represented in <xref ref="fig-SIR-compartmental-diagram"/>. Let us think about what the values of <m>\gamma</m> should be.

      <activity xml:id="activity-understanding-gamma-pt1">
        <statement>
          <p>
            What would it mean if <m>\gamma =1</m>, <m>\gamma =0.5</m>, or <m>\gamma =0.25</m>? Specifically: what fraction of the members of the I compartment leaves I <em>within one unit of time</em> for each of these values of <m>\gamma</m>? For instance, if the unit of time in the SIR model is days, then what fraction of the members of the I compartment leaves I within one day? Similarly, what percentage of the members of the I compartment leaves I <em>within one unit of time</em> for each value of <m>\gamma</m>?

        <answer>
          <p>
            If <m>\gamma =1</m>, then all members of compartment I, that is, <m>100\%</m> of the members, leave I at each unit of time. If <m>\gamma =0.5</m>, then half the members, that is, <m>50\%</m>, leave I at each unit of time. And if <m>\gamma =0.25</m>, then one-quarter of the members, that is, <m>25\%</m>, leave I at each unit of time.

            Using what you learned in <xref ref="activity-understanding-gamma-pt1"/>, think further about <m>\gamma =1</m>, <m>\gamma =0.5</m>, or <m>\gamma =0.25</m>. For each of these values of <m>\gamma</m>, how long does a typical individual remain in compartment I before leaving for compartment R?

        <answer>
          <p>
            If <m>\gamma =1</m>, then all members of compartment I leave at each unit of time, so a typical individual stays in I for one unit of time. If <m>\gamma =0.5</m>, then half the members of I leave at each unit of time, so a typical individual stays in I for approximately two units of time. And if <m>\gamma =0.25</m>, then one-quarter of the members of I leave at each unit of time, so a typical individual stays in I for approximately four units of time.

      <p>
        We begin to see in <xref ref="activity-understanding-gamma-pt2"/> that we can understand <m>\gamma</m> intuitively in relationship to how long an individual is in the I compartment. A compartmental model does not track individuals directly, and the responses in <xref ref="activity-understanding-gamma-pt2"/> do not suggest that every individual in an outbreak is sick for a precise amount of time that is shown by <m>\gamma</m>. Instead, the relationship between <m>\gamma</m> and length of time in compartment I shows how long <em>on average</em> individuals stay in compartment I. We can write this relationship mathematically:
      </p>
      <mdn>
        <mrow xml:id="eq-gamma-estimate">\frac{1}{\gamma} \amp \approx \mbox{average length of time an individual spends in compartment I.} </mrow>
      </mdn>
      <p>
        Another way to phrase this, when being in the I compartment corresponds to a person being infectious (however <q>infectious</q> is defined in a given model) is:
      </p>
      <mdn>
        <mrow xml:id="eq-gamma-estimate-2">\frac{1}{\gamma} \amp \approx \mbox{average length of time an individual is infectious.} </mrow>
      </mdn>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="exercises-ch-compartmental-diagrams"/> we use the ideas in <xref ref="eq-gamma-estimate"/> and <xref ref="eq-gamma-estimate-2"/> to estimate <m>\gamma</m> for specific outbreaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice that <m>1/\gamma</m> is an amount of time. This means that the units of <m>\gamma</m> are <m>1/\mbox{time}</m>. This observation corresponds with <m>\gamma</m> being a <term>rate</term>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many, but not all, of the parameters in the models in this text are rates. Usually, when a parameter in a compartmental model is a rate, we can estimate its value in a similar way to how we estimate <m>\gamma</m> in <xref ref="eq-gamma-estimate"/>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, notice that <m>\beta</m> in our model can not be a rate. We see this when we recognize that each term in a model equation must have the same units: otherwise, we cannot set terms equal to each other, or add or subtract terms. Explore how this works in <xref ref="activity-introducing-units"/>.

            In <xref ref="activity-sir-diagram-and-des"/>, we developed the following system of differential equations for the SIR model shown in <xref ref="fig-SIR-compartmental-diagram"/>:

            <mrow xml:id="eq-SIR-model-S">\frac{dS}{dt} \amp = -\beta S I </mrow>

            Recall that each of the variables <m>S</m>, <m>I</m>, and <m>R</m> represents some average number of individuals. This means that the units for each of <m>S</m>, <m>I</m>, and <m>R</m> are <em>population</em>.<fn>Alternatively, we could call these units <em>people</em> or <em>individuals</em>.</fn> We also just saw from the discussion of <xref ref="eq-gamma-estimate"/> that the units of <m>\gamma</m> are <m>1/\mbox{time}</m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                Consider the equation <m>\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I</m> from the SIR model. What are the units of the term <m>\frac{dR}{dt}</m> on the left-hand side, and what are the units of the term <m>\gamma I</m> on the right-hand side? Can you confirm that these two terms have the same units?
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Next, consider the equation <m>\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta S I - \gamma I</m> from the SIR model. Start by using the first part of this activity to determine the units of <m>\frac{dI}{dt}</m> and <m>\gamma I</m>. Next, in order for the units to be the same for all three terms, what should the units be for <m>\beta S I</m>? Finally, knowing the units of <m>\beta S I</m>, what must be the units for <m>\beta</m>?
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Use your results from the first two parts of this activity to confirm that the units are the same on both sides of the equation <m>\frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta S I</m> in the SIR model.
              </p>
            </li>

        <answer>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                The term <m>\frac{dR}{dt}</m> has units <m>\mbox{(population)} / \mbox{(time)}</m> because the units of <m>R</m> in the numerator are <em>population</em> and the units of <m>t</m> in the denominator are <em>time</em>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The term <m>\gamma I</m> has units <m>\mbox{(population)} / \mbox{(time)}</m> because <m>\gamma</m> has units <m>1/\mbox{time}</m> and <m>I</m> has units (population).
              </p>
              <p>
                Both sides have the same units, namely <m>\mbox{(population)} / \mbox{(time)}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The terms <m>\frac{dI}{dt}</m> and <m>\gamma I</m> have units <m>\mbox{(population)} / \mbox{(time)}</m>, for similar reasons to those described in the first part of this activity.
              </p>
              <p>
                The term <m>\beta S I</m> should therefore also have units <m>\mbox{(population)} / \mbox{(time)}</m>. Since there are two populations, <m>S</m> and <m>I</m>, multiplied in the numerator, this means that <m>\beta</m> must have units <m>1/(\mbox{population} \cdot \mbox{time})</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The term <m>\frac{dS}{dt}</m> has units <m>\mbox{(population)} / \mbox{(time)}</m>, for similar reasons to those described in the first part of this activity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Within the term <m>-\beta S I</m>, we saw in the second part of this activity that <m>\beta</m> has units <m>1/(\mbox{population} \cdot \mbox{time})</m>. Both <m>S</m> and <m>I</m> have units (population). Multiplying together the three terms <m>\beta</m>, <m>S</m>, and <m>I</m>, the resulting units are <m>\mbox{(population)} / \mbox{(time)}</m>. 
              </p>
              <p>
                These observations confirm that the units are the same on both sides of the equation <m>\frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta S I</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </answer>
      </activity>
      <p>
        After completing <xref ref="activity-introducing-units"/>, we recognize that in our SIR model, the units of <m>\beta</m> are not <m>1/\mbox{time}</m>. Therefore <m>\beta</m> is not a rate, and we cannot estimate the value of <m>\beta</m> similarly to how we estimate the value of <m>\gamma</m>. Indeed, estimating the value of <m>\beta</m> will require different methods. In <xref ref="ch-visualization-graphing-model-results-and-data"/> we discuss estimating <m>\beta</m> visually by comparing our model with data. In <xref ref="ch-model-analysis-and-the-basic-reproduction-number-R0"/> and <xref ref="ch-vaccines"/> we introduce another way to estimate <m>\beta</m>, using other parameter values we know, along with a formula involving an epidemiological concept known as the <term>basic reproduction number</term>.
