      <p>
        So far, to determine the value of <m>\beta</m> in a compartmental model, we have done one of two things: 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            estimated <m>\beta</m> visually by comparing the model's solution curves with data, or
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            used a formula for <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m>, such as <m>\mathcal{R}_0 = (\beta N)/\gamma</m>, to substitute in values we know for <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m>, <m>N</m>, and <m>\gamma</m>, rearrange, and solve for <m>\beta</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        However, the formula for <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> is not always <m>\mathcal{R}_0 = (\beta N)/\gamma</m>. Systems of differential equations having different compartments, or systems in which the flow between compartments is different than what we have worked with before, can have different formulas for <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m>. These formulas are usually not obvious. However, a method exists that allows us to determine the formula. This is the Next Generation Method.

        To use the Next Generation Method, we will need to be familiar with matrices, eigenvalues, equilibrium values for a system of differential equations, and partial derivatives. <xref ref="expl-activity-next-generation-method"/> was a reminder about matrices and eigenvalues, and we will build more knowledge about these linear algebra concepts. But first, use <xref ref="activity-equilibrium-values"/> and <xref ref="activity-partial-derivatives"/> to learn about equilibrium values and partial derivatives.

      <activity xml:id="activity-equilibrium-values">
        <statement>
          <p>
            This activity identifies equilibrium values for two systems of differential equations that we have worked with as compartmental models.  
          </p>
          <ol>              
            <li>
              <p>
                Consider the SI model below: 
              </p>
              <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dS}{dt} \amp = - \beta S I </mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dI}{dt} \amp =  \beta S I. </mrow>
            </md>
            <p>
              For a system of differential equations, being at equilibrium means that the dependent variables in the system are not changing as the independent variables change. For the SI model, this means that <m>S</m> and <m>I</m> are not changing as time <m>t</m> changes. Using knowledge from calculus: what can we say about each of the derivatives <m>dS/dt</m> and <m>dI/dt</m> when the system is at equilibrium?

            <li>
              <p>
                Next: determine the possible values of <m>S</m> and <m>I</m> for which the SI model is at equilibrium.

              <p>
                Next consider the SEIR model below:

              <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dS}{dt} \amp = - \beta S I </mrow>

                Can you determine possible values of <m>S</m>, <m>E</m>, <m>I</m>, and <m>R</m> for which the SEIR model is at equilibrium? In doing this, be sure the overall population is nonzero, that is, <m>S+E+I+R \neq 0</m>.
              </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                For the system to be at equilibrium, each of the derivatives must equal <m>0</m>. 
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>S=0</m>, the SI model is at equilibrium. This corresponds to a situation where the entire population is in the <m>I</m> compartment.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Alternately, if <m>I=0</m>, the SI model is at equilibrium. This corresponds to a situation where the entire population is in the <m>S</m> compartment.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The SEIR model is at equilibrium when <m>E=0</m> and <m>I=0</m>. The rest of the population can be divided in any way between the <m>S</m> and <m>R</m> compartments.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </answer>
      </activity>

      <p>
        You may have noticed in <xref ref="activity-equilibrium-values"/>, part 3, that there are many ways to arrive at equilbrium. It is true that the <m>E</m> and <m>I</m> compartments should be empty, but the population can be distributed in any way across compartments <m>S</m> and <m>R</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For the work we will do in this chapter, we decide the population distribution by seeking the <term>disease-free equilibrium</term>. This is the particular equilibrium value that occurs in a situation where disease has not yet appeared in a population. In the SEIR model, for instance, equilibrium requires <m>E=I=0</m>, with the rest of the population split somehow across the <m>S</m> and <m>R</m> compartments. <em>Disease-free equilibrium</em> adds the extra requirement that the population all be in the <m>S</m> compartment. This means <m>S=N</m>, where <m>N</m> represents the entire population, as first defined in <xref ref="activity-total-population"/>. Then the other three populations, <m>E</m>, <m>I</m>, and <m>R</m>, all equal <m>0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        One way to write the disease-free equilibrium is <m>(\overline{S}, \overline{E}, \overline{I}, \overline{R})=(N, 0, 0, 0)</m>. The bar over each of the population letters <m>S</m>, <m>E</m>, <m>I</m>, and <m>R</m> represents an equilibrium value for that population.
      </p> 
      <p>
        For the models we have studied so far, disease-free equilibrium requires that the entire population start in the <m>S</m> compartment, but there exist compartmental models where the initial population can be split across multiple compartments. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the concept of the disease-free equilibrium value, we also work with partial derivatives when performing the Next Generation Method. Gain practice with partial derivatives in <xref ref="activity-partial-derivatives"/>.

            This course requires mainly the calculus concepts from a Calculus I course. These concepts include working with derivatives, understanding that a derivative is a rate of change, knowing that the slope on a graph relates directly to the derivative of a function, and recognizing that positive slopes (or, equivalently, positive derivatives) correspond to increasing functions and, similarly, negative slopes (or, equivalently, negative derivatives) correspond to decreasing functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Next Generation Method also requires us to compute <em>partial derivatives</em>. 
            <!-- These are derivatives in which we work with a formula that may involve multiple dependent variables, but we temporarily think of all but one of those variables as a constant so that we can compute a derivative of the one remaining dependent variable, as the independent variable (which, for us, is always time) changes. -->
            To see how this works, progress through the steps below.

                Start by computing derivatives as you would during Calculus I.

                    For the function <m>f(x)=3x^2 + 5x + 7</m>, compute its derivative <m>f'(x)</m>. This can also be written <m>\frac{d}{dx}(3x^2 + 5x + 7)</m>.

                  <p>
                    Then, for the related function <m>g(x)=ax^2 + bx + c</m>, compute its derivative. The values <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> are all constants. This derivative can also be written <m>\frac{d}{dx}(ax^2 + bx + c)</m>.

                    Write and/or discuss an observation about the role constants play when computing derivatives.

How, then, how do you think about <m>3</m> or <m>a</m>, compared with how you think about <m>x^2</m>? Ask similar questions about computing derivatives of each of the other terms in <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m>.

                Many Calculus I courses discuss <em>implicit differentiation</em>. Try this example so that implicit differentiation will be fresh in your mind.

              <p>
                For the function <m>x^2+y^2=4</m>, compute its derivative with respect to <m>x</m>, using the information that <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>. 
                    <m>y \, '</m>. Do this by computing derivatives of both <m>x^2</m> and <m>y^2</m>, and then solving for <m>y \, '</m>, meaning that your response is written as <q><m>y \, ' = \, </m> </q> followed by the derivative formula you have computed.
                    This means that you will compute the derivative of <m>x^2</m> similarly to how you computed derivatives in part (1) of this activity. For computing the derivative of <m>y^2</m>, use a similar derivative formula as for the derivative of <m>x^2</m>, and then use the chain rule to multiply by the derivative of <m>y</m>, which can be written as <m>y \, '</m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                Next, we introduce <em>partial derivatives</em>. Whereas in part (1) we computed derivatives with respect to <m>x</m>, we now allow ourselves to compute derivatives with respect to other variables in a formula. 
              </p>

                    Consider this differential equation from the SEIR model: <m>\frac{dE}{dt} = \beta S I - \kappa E</m>. Compute the derivative of the right-hand side, with respect to <m>E</m>. That is, compute <m>\frac{\partial}{\partial E}(\beta S I - \kappa E)</m>. When computing the derivative with respect to <m>E</m>: think of <m>S</m> and <m>I</m> as constants. Both <m>\beta</m> and <m>\kappa</m> are constants, as always. Think of <m>E</m> as the only variable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You may notice that we have switched from the notation <m>\frac{d}{dE}</m> to the notation <m>\frac{\partial}{\partial E}</m>. This is the notation used when we have multiple choices for our variable of interest: we are focusing on <m>E</m>, but we could have chosen any other variable in our system of equations. The idea of <em>partial derivatives</em> is that there are multiple variables involved, and as each of them changes, the entire system is affected, but we focus on one variable at a time, therefore looking at <em>part</em> of the change of the system rather than the <em>total</em> change of the system. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This emphasis on one variable at a time benefits our understanding by showing how change in each variable<mdash/>in our case, change in each compartment<mdash/>affects the outcome of the entire system.

        The code block below produces the eigenvalues for the SEIR model. This code can also be used as a template for producing eigenvalues when the Next Generation Method produces a <m>2\times 2</m> matrix.
      </p>

      <p>
        Spend some time looking through the code. Be sure you see how and where matrices are entered. You can use similar code for other compartmental models, and the only parts you need to change are the <m>F</m> and <m>V</m> matrices.

          The code block below produces the eigenvalues for the SLIAR model. This code can also be used as a template for producing eigenvalues when the Next Generation Method produces a <m>3\times 3</m> matrix. Comparing this code with the previous code may help show how similar the code is when computing the Next Generation matrix for different models, as well as showing what to change for a different model.

          For the function <m>x^2+y^2=4</m>, compute its derivative with respect to <m>x</m>, using the information that <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>. 
          <m>y \, '</m>. Do this by computing derivatives of both <m>x^2</m> and <m>y^2</m>, and then solving for <m>y \, '</m>, meaning that your response is written as <q><m>y \, ' = \, </m> </q> followed by the derivative formula you have computed.
          This means that you will compute the derivative of <m>x^2</m> similarly to how you computed derivatives in part (1) of this activity. For computing the derivative of <m>y^2</m>, use a similar derivative formula as for the derivative of <m>x^2</m>, and then use the chain rule to multiply by the derivative of <m>y</m>, which can be written as <m>y \, '</m>.

         Notice that, for the derivatives of both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, the independent variable is <m>x</m>. This means that the derivative for <m>x</m> could be written as <m>\frac{d}{dx}(x)</m>, meaning <q>the derivative of <m>x</m>, with respect to <m>x</m></q>, while the derivative for <m>y</m> could be written as <m>\frac{d}{dx}(y)</m>, meaning <q>the derivative of <m>y</m>, with respect to <m>x</m></q>. With this mathematical background in mind, comment on what the derivative formula is for <m>x</m>, compared with what the derivative formula is for <m>y</m>.
