      <p>
        So far, we have estimated <m>\beta</m> in two ways: (1) visually, making adjustments so that data and graphs are closer together, starting in <xref ref="ch-visualization-graphing-model-results-and-data"/>, and (2) using a formula involving <m>\mathcal{R}_0</m> and parameters from our model, such as in <xref ref="eq-R0-sir"/> and <xref ref="eq-R0-seir"/>, to substitute in values we could find from epidemiological information and solve for <m>\beta</m>, which is typically the only unknown value in the formula. In this chapter, we learn a new approach.     
      </p>  
  
      <p>
        Begin in <xref ref="expl-RSS"/> by examining data points as well as values determined by an SI model. In this exploration, think about mathematical approaches to improve the model's fit to data.

        <p>
          One way to compare data with a graph is by computing the Residual Sum of Squares. When we work with a single model to try to improve the fit of the model to a data set, RSS is a good option. <xref ref="activity-rss-intro"/> shows the process of computing RSS for a model with one choice for a value of <m>\beta</m>. Later, we show how to compare RSS for different values of <m>\beta</m> used in the same model.

              Since the three differential equations sum to zero, the change in total population is <m>0</m>. This tells us that the total population in our model does not change. In other words, the size of the total population <m>N(t)</m> remains constant.

        Now try computing RSS using the influenza prevalence data. The data are already written into the code block below. Time 0 is the same as October 6.

      <p>
        Notice in the line <c>RSS = RSS + (I_prevalence_data[x] - sol[0 + 10 * x, 1])**2</c> that instead of writing <c>sol[0 + 10 * x, 0]</c> we write <c>sol[0 + 10 * x, 1]</c>. Changing the <c>0</c> to a <c>1</c> tells Python to use the next column of model values from the array of S, I, and R values, that is, to use column 1 of Infectious values rather than column 0 of Susceptible values. It is important to choose the correct column of model values when comparing with data values.
