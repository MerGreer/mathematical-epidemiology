<div class="para">When vaccines are studied and approved for use, researchers demonstrate their <dfn class="terminology">efficacy</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">effectiveness</dfn>. Both terms consider how many people within a population of vaccinated individuals get a disease, compared with how many people within a comparable population of unvaccinated individuals get the same disease. If, for instance, <span class="process-math">\(75\%\)</span> fewer people in the vaccinated population get the disease, then we say the vaccine has an efficacy or effectiveness of <span class="process-math">\(75\%\text{.}\)</span><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-44-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a> The word <em class="emphasis">efficacy</em> specifies that the comparison of vaccinated and unvaccinated populations happens within a clinical trial. The word <em class="emphasis">effectiveness</em> indicates that the vaccine is being studied for populations in the real world. While clinical trials do include a range of different people, effectiveness often differs from efficacy.</div>
