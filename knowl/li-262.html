<div class="para">Ask some questions of your model. Two sample questions are, “What happens if the campus vastly increases its number and distribution of hand sanitizing stations?” and “How much do the model's results change as the initial number of infectious people changes?”. There are many other questions you can ask. Use Python code blocks from elsewhere in the text to answer your questions. Select a code block that includes the type of model you are using (such as SIR, SEIR, and possibly vaccination) and make whatever changes you need.</div>
<div class="para">Once you have addressed each question, write about your results. Include information about what question you asked and why it was a reasonable question, given the outbreak being studied. In addition to writing your response using words, incorporate other evidence, such as graphs and long-term values of Susceptibles or other compartments. Think throughout about structuring your response logically; indicating your priorities; explaining the change you made and why you made it; and explaining what happened when you made that change.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ch-getting-the-answer-right-in-modeling.html#li-262" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
