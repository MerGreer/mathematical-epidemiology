<div class="para">There may be other priorities as well, and we may not even realize when we start model building that we are incorporating those priorities. A student project I once advised produced one very powerful example of priorities that we do not see initially. This project forms the idea behind <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/activity-priorities-HIV-AIDS.html" title="Activity 7.6">ActivityÂ 7.6</a>. Though this student put tremendous thought and research into creating their model, <em class="emphasis">the results of the model showed</em> that the student's priorities had not been properly built into the model. This new understanding led the student to revise the model to better include their priorities.</div>
