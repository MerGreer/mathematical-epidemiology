<div class="para">There are many other things you may notice. To name just a few ideas: you may think about the speed with which each curve rises or falls. You may think about how much these speeds change when you try the game several times. You may relate a rise in one graph to a fall in the other, thinking about a sort of symmetry between the two graphs. You may think about when the rising or falling is relatively slow vs. relatively fast. These and many other observations are a valued and central part of working toward mathematical model building.</div>
