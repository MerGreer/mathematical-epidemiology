<div class="para">This model uses differential equations, which think of time as continuous, using every real value for <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> starting at <span class="process-math">\(t=0\text{.}\)</span> By contrast, when we collect data from the zombie game, time is <dfn class="terminology">discrete</dfn>, meaning that time steps forward through values such as “Day 0”, “Day 1”, “Day 2”, and so on. In this course, we mainly use differential equation models, meaning time is thought of as <dfn class="terminology">continuous</dfn>. Continuous time may match well with our intuitive sense of how time works: time does not stop and start. However, the data we collect about disease spread will often be discrete, on time scales such as days or weeks. We will include this knowledge in our work with models.</div>
