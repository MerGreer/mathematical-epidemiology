<div class="para">With these calculus ideas in mind, we return to our model. We will write two equations, one to represent the change in the Susceptible population and one to represent the change in the Infectious population. When we say “change”, we mean the change that happens on average if we were to run the simulation many times. Our independent variable is time, which we label <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> You may have noticed that time is the variable on the horizontal axis: this axis is labeled “Round” in the app, and it represents time in the form of days. For our dependent variables, we choose letters that correspond to the names of each population. This makes the dependent variable meanings easier to remember, and for many people, it makes the differential equations easier to interpret. Therefore let <span class="process-math">\(S = S(t)\)</span> represent the Susceptible population and <span class="process-math">\(I = I(t)\)</span> represent the Infectious population. Since our populations are represented by the letters <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(I\text{,}\)</span> we call this model an <dfn class="terminology">SI model</dfn>. We say the names of each of the first two letters when saying “SI model” aloud, that is, we say “S” “I” “model”.</div>
