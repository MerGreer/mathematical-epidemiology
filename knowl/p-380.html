<div class="para">It is possible to compute the formula for <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> from the equations in a compartmental model. The most common way to do this is called the Next Generation Method. Because the Next Generation Method uses partial derivatives and techniques from linear algebra, it is described in the optional sections <a href="ch-the-next-generation-method-using-r0-to-determine-beta.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 13: * The Next Generation Method: Using \mathcal{R}_0 to Determine \beta">Chapter 13</a> and <a href="ch-the-next-generation-method-connecting-theory-with-practice.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 15: * The Next Generation Method: Underlying Theory">Chapter 15</a>. In particular, <a href="ch-the-next-generation-method-using-r0-to-determine-beta.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 13: * The Next Generation Method: Using \mathcal{R}_0 to Determine \beta">Chapter 13</a> teaches the process in a way that can be used by students who are new to matrix operations and partial derivatives: there are a few math techniques to learn, and Python does the rest. Readers who include <a href="ch-the-next-generation-method-using-r0-to-determine-beta.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 13: * The Next Generation Method: Using \mathcal{R}_0 to Determine \beta">Chapter 13</a> will be able to solve for the formula for <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> in their own models. As an alternative, the <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> formulas for several commonly used compartmental models are provided directly throughout this text.</div>
