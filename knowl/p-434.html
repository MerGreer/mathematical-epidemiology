Initially, we will think of vaccination as being <span class="process-math">\(100\%\)</span> effective.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-40-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> When the fraction <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> of people are vaccinated, the remaining fraction <span class="process-math">\((1-p)\)</span> are not vaccinated. Since <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> refers to an entirely susceptible population, but only the fraction <span class="process-math">\((1-p)\)</span> of the population is susceptible, we see that the average number of new infections caused by one infectious person in the vaccinated population is <span class="process-math">\((1-p)\mathcal{R}_0\text{.}\)</span> In other words:</div>
