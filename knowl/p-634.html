<div class="para">A compartmental model is a style of mathematical model in which the subjects of the model are grouped into categories called <em class="emphasis">compartments</em>. Such a model follows the overall outcomes for each compartment, but does not typically track the outcomes of smaller groups such as individuals. The compartmental models in this text use differential equations to demonstrate the interactions and rates governing how many individuals move from one group to another at specific points in time.  As one example of a compartmental model, an SIR model consists of three compartments: S, I, and R. Most often in this text, compartment S represents Susceptible individuals, compartment I represents Infectious individuals, and compartment R represents Removed individuals. (Chapter 4)</div>
