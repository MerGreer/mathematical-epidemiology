<div class="para">The setup of a model matters. Definitions of compartments and rate parameters matter. Initial conditions, such as initial numbers of people in the population of each compartment, matter. All aspects of a model should reflect our priorities and goals, as described in <a href="ch-getting-the-answer-right-in-modeling.html#sec-priorities-where-goals-meet-ethics" class="internal" title="Section 7.2: Priorities: Where Goals Meet Ethics">Section 7.2</a>, and should fit together logically, as described in <a href="ch-getting-the-answer-right-in-modeling.html#sec-the-logical-approach" class="internal" title="Section 7.1: The Logical Approach">Section 7.1</a>. We endeavor to get all these model details right on the first try, incorporating research into the disease being modeled and the populations involved in the outbreak. Yet the act of building and using a model often shows us more details to consider, such as what was described in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/activity-priorities-HIV-AIDS.html" title="Activity 7.6">Activity 7.6</a>. Other changes to models may be motivated by asking different questions, gathering new data, updating information about an outbreak, or many other reasons. <em class="emphasis">Making changes to models is a central part of the modeling process</em>.</div>
