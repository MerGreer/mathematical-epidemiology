<div class="para">There are footnotes in this book, appearing as a raised number.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-2-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> In the web version of the book, clicking on the raised number shows the footnote in a box that opens below the paragraph. The web version of the book also contains live links. Some of the links, such as to chapters, take you to different pages of the book. Other links, such as to figures or equations that we saw earlier in the text, open a box showing these figures or equations directly where you are reading, so that you can see them without jumping from webpage to webpage. You will also see Python code boxes in this text, with a button after that says <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Evaluate (Sage)</code>. In the web version of this text, you can click on the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Evaluate (Sage)</code> button to evaluate the code directly within the book.</div>
