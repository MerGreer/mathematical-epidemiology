<body class="ignore-math"><div class="fn">Vaccination is a widely used public health strategy. Yet the author of this text recognizes that reader thoughts on vaccines may vary for many reasons. As mentioned way back in the “To Students” preface, “I will not tell you how to think.” Instead, the goal of showing vaccines in models is to demonstrate some of the ways we can use models to try different scenarios. Readers can and should continue to think about their own ethics and experiences when interpreting and discussing models</div></body>
