<div class="para">Imagine a new outbreak occurs in a small town of 5000 people. Let us suppose it makes sense to model this outbreak with an SIR model, where the compartments are Susceptible (people who are not sick but can become sick), Infectious (people who are currently able to spread the disease), and Removed (people who are no longer able to spread the disease and are unable to become sick again). At the start of the outbreak, a single person is Infectious, and the rest of the people are Susceptible.</div>
