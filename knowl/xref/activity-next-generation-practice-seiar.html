<em class="emphasis">Mathematical Epidemiology</em> was edited by Fred Brauer, Pauline van den Driessche, and Jianhong Wu, and published by Springer in 2008. The model we describe comes from Chapter 12, which was written by Fred Brauer, and is labeled SLIAR. Our version is labeled SEIAR to stay consistent with notation we have used in other chapters.</div></details> introduces a model of influenza having five compartments. This model has a Susceptibles (S) compartment that is similar to what we have seen before. There is then an Exposed-and-incubating (E) compartment for people incubating influenza who are not yet able to spread influenza to others. After that, people may be Infectious (I), meaning they have symptoms and can spread influenza, or they may be Asymptomatic (A), meaning they do not have symptoms but can still spread influenza to others. In this model, Asymptomatic (A) people are less able to spread influenza than Infectious (I) people. Many people then move into a Recovered (R) compartment, but those who die depart the model rather than moving into the R compartment. The compartmental diagram for this model appears in <a href="ch-the-next-generation-method.html#fig-SEIAR-compartmental-diagram" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-SEIAR-compartmental-diagram.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 14.2">Figure 14.2</a>.
