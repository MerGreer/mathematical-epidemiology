<div class="para">Notice the arrow labeled <span class="process-math">\(\kappa E\text{.}\)</span> The flow out of the E compartment depends only on the population <span class="process-math">\(E(t)\)</span> and the amount of time typically spent as Exposed-and-incubating, similar to how the flow out of the I compartment in the SIR and SEIR models depends only on the population <span class="process-math">\(I(t)\)</span> and the amount of time spent as Infectious. An important comment here is that this answer key uses the parameter <span class="process-math">\(\kappa\)</span> for the rate governing the flow out of the E compartment, but there is no reason at all that you should have chosen the Greek letter <span class="process-math">\(\kappa\)</span> for this rate! Whatever letter you chose, as long as it is not a letter already in use elsewhere in the model, is an excellent choice.</div>

<div class="para">The following differential equations represent the SEIR model:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} \amp = - \beta S I \\
\frac{dE}{dt} \amp =  \beta S I - \kappa E \\
\frac{dI}{dt} \amp =  \kappa E - \gamma I \\
\frac{dR}{dt} \amp = \gamma I. 
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">Your answer should look similar, but you may have selected a different parameter instead of <span class="process-math">\(\kappa\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="para">Your answers for the first two parts should definitely be compatible. If they are not, whether in this activity or ever in your modeling career, then that is a time to re-evaluate your work. This is one of many ways we can double-check our modeling work: when we describe a model in different formats, such as in a diagram and by means of equations, the different formats should agree with each other.</div></li>
