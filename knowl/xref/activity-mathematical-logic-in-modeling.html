<li><div class="para">Suppose we use an SIR model to represent an outbreak in a population of 10,000 people. In this model, the S compartment contains the Susceptibles, that is, people who are not sick but can become sick. The I compartment contains the Infectious, that is, people who are currently able to spread the disease. The R compartment contains the Removed, that is, people who are no longer able to spread the disease and are unable to become sick again. Suppose we estimate the parameters to be <span class="process-math">\(\beta \approx 0.0001\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\gamma \approx 0.4\text{.}\)</span> If, at the start of the outbreak, ten people are Infectious and the rest are Susceptible, then by the end of the outbreak, the model suggests that <span class="process-math">\(1071\)</span> will remain Susceptible, that is, <span class="process-math">\(1071\)</span> people will never have become Infectious.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Suppose we use the same SIR model equations described above, with the same initial conditions and the same value of <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\text{.}\)</span> However, public health measures are implemented, so that <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> is estimated to fall to approximately <span class="process-math">\(0.00005\text{.}\)</span> In this situation, the model suggests that <span class="process-math">\(6257\)</span> people will remain Susceptible at the end of the outbreak.</div></li>
