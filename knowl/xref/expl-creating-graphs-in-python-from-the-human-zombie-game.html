<div class="introduction"><div class="para">If you have never used Python before, you are in the right place! If you have used Python, you may be able to move through this chapter more quickly, but be sure to spend time to make sure you know the code you need to complete modeling tasks. In this chapter, we spend a significant amount of time reading code, viewing code output, and making changes to code, to build up enough Python knowledge to be able to generate additional graphs of data and model results. The code we practice with allows us to visualize the sample data set shown as a table in <a href="ch-zombies-can-math-help.html#fig-human-zombie-data-table" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-human-zombie-data-table.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 2.5">Figure 2.5</a>.</div></div>

</ul></article><div class="conclusion"><div class="para">The first two lines of the Python code are important, but their phrasing does not make very obvious what they do. Line 1 imports a Python package that includes commands for drawing plots. Line 2 clears any past plots, meaning any past plots should be completely gone. This makes sure that any new plot contains only what we want. Line 2 may not be needed when we very first use Python, but if we create a different plot, and then come back to this code cell and re-enter it, the other plot we created could be overlaid with this one. The “clear” command, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">plt.cla()</code>, makes sure that only our current plot appears.</div></div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="ch-visualization-graphing-model-results-and-data.html#expl-creating-graphs-in-python-from-the-human-zombie-game">in-context</a></span>
