<div class="introduction"><div class="para">In this activity, use the knowledge you have been building about mathematical modeling to develop two possible mathematical models, one for complete isolation and one for incomplete isolation. We set these models in fictional small, remote towns, where people interact with each other frequently, but there are not a lot of visitors to town or travel of town residents elsewhere. We therefore focus the model just on the town’s residents. We also focus this model on an outbreak of a fictional ``Disease X’’, for which <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0 \approx 4\)</span> and the infectious period is approximately 8 days.</div></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h4>
<div class="para">First, consider ``Town A’’, which has 6,000 residents, and imagine a scenario of complete isolation. That is, suppose that as soon as people know they are sick with Disease X, they isolate completely, having no contact with anyone else. Fortunately, Town A has found a way to deliver food and supplies, and to otherwise care for, people who are sick. Unfortunately, people are infectious with Disease X two days before they know they are sick, so they cannot isolate yet during those two days.</div> <ol class="decimal" id="expl-activity-isolation-3-1-2">
<li><div class="para">Write an SIR model for this outbreak, without (yet) including isolation. (Do not include vaccine or incubation period in your model.) Determine all parameter values for your model.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Adjust your SIR model to incorporate isolation, which in Town A is complete as soon as Infectious individuals know they are sick. Show both the differential equations and compartmental diagram for your adjusted model. Determine all parameter values for this adjusted model.</div></li>
</ol></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h4>
<div class="para">Next, consider ``Town B’’, which has 8,000 residents, and think of ways to model incomplete isolation. Suppose that Disease X appears in Town B, but Town B’s people do not have a way to care for or deliver supplies to people who are sick. This means that friends, family members, care workers, or others interact somewhat with the Infectious who know they are sick. Therefore, isolation is not complete, though individuals do reduce their interactions with others as soon as they know they are sick, that is, typically two days after first becoming contagious.</div> <ol class="decimal" id="expl-activity-isolation-4-1-2">
<li><div class="para">Adjust your original SIR model, which did not have isolation, to incorporate the incomplete isolation described for Town B. (Do not include vaccine or incubation period in your model.) Show both the differential equations and a compartmental diagram for your adjusted model. Determine all parameter values for this adjusted model.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Discuss the differences between your models for complete and incomplete isolation, and discuss the reasons for your modeling choices.</div></li>
