<div class="para">For this activity, we model a simplified version of early COVID-19 using an SEIR model in which the compartment definitions may differ from what we have seen before. For each question below, part of the response includes clarifying the definitions of compartments. Here are comments on each compartment, where terms such as “could”, “may”, and “in some cases” indicate aspects of compartment definitions that change, depending on how we define the compartments in a specific model.</div> <ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Susceptibles (S) are people who have not yet become sick, and who can become sick. The Susceptibles could, in some cases, include people who have been vaccinated and therefore have less chance of becoming sick.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The Exposed-and-incubating (E) compartment includes people who have gotten the COVID-19 virus but not yet become infectious, and this class may include people with and without vaccination.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The Infectious (I) compartment includes people who are currently infectious, regardless of the severity of their symptoms, and in some cases, people in the Infectious compartment are also assumed to be interacting with Susceptibles.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The Removed (R) compartment may consist of people who have recovered from COVID-19, died from COVID-19, or entirely isolated themselves from others, so that they cannot spread COVID-19 at all.</div></li>
</ul> <div class="para">The equations for the SEIR model are below. Use these, along with the Python code block, to answer the questions that follow.</div> <div class="para">For questions 2, 3, and possibly 4, first <em class="emphasis">imagine how changes to initial population values or parameter values can change outcomes in the model</em>. That is, truly think through this in your mind, and write down your thoughts, before proceeding with changes. For reference, the values in the original model are based very loosely on Lombardy, Italy, in early 2020. The total population was approximately ten million. The value of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> was estimated to be <span class="process-math">\(2.6-3.3\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\kappa\)</span> is estimated at about <span class="process-math">\(1/6.5\text{.}\)</span><details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="activity-changing-models-COVID-19-1-4-6"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 8.1"><sup> 1 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="activity-changing-models-COVID-19-1-4-6">These estimates come from the paper “The early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Lombardy, Italy” by many researchers, published in the journal <em class="emphasis">Epidemics</em> in December 2021.</div></details> The value of <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(1/14\text{,}\)</span> indicating an average of two weeks of being infectious. This is based on many reports suggesting that most people were infectious for one to two weeks, but that some people were infectious for much longer. There was vast variation on how early COVID-19 affected people, which is part of the reason we need to consider changes and updates to models.</div> <div class="para">Next, try your changes in Python, creating before-and-after graphs. The code block includes sections titled “original model” and “your changes to the model”: scroll through to the “your changes to the model” version to make updates. Then go to the “plotting commands” section to choose the compartments for which you would like to show graphs; the default is to show I(t) for both the original and updated versions. Notice that if you were to show all four compartments, before and after, there would be eight total curves, which can be complicated for a reader to understand. Instead, prioritize the graphs that best illustrate your findings, probably showing no more than two or four total graphs at a time.</div>

<li><div class="para">Early public health measures aimed to “flatten the curve”. The idea was that, even without vaccines or COVID-19-specific medicines, we could slow the spread of the outbreak by having people stay distant from each other. Which parameter(s) in the SEIR model are most affected when people maintain physical distance from each other? Try changing the parameter(s) you have chosen in the Python block and compare your results with the original result.</div></li>

This book does not require readers to have any one opinion about vaccine usage. We use models to address questions about vaccines, and readers are invited to do the same, building models that represent different vaccine-based outcomes and using those models to determine outcomes and dynamics of COVID-19, with and without vaccines.</div></details> The plan was for vaccines to address COVID-19 in multiple ways; we will address two such ways here. One way was for people to be less likely to get COVID-19. Another way was to reduce the severity or length of time ill for people who did get COVID-19. For each of these ways of addressing COVID-19: which compartments and/or parameters in the SEIR model are affected? Prepare before-and-after versions of the model, carefully defining each compartment and parameter in the before model and again in the after model. Then use the Python graph to generate graphs comparing the outcomes before and after vaccines.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Do more open-ended exploration. How else can we use the SEIR model to address questions about the early spread of an outbreak?
