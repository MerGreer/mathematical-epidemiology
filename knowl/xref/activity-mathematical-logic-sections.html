<div class="para">For each of the following mathematical statements, specify the <em class="emphasis">assumptions</em> and the <em class="emphasis">conclusions</em>. There may be multiple assumptions and/or conclusions per statement. The words “if” and/or “then” may not appear explicitly. If cases when these words do not appear, it may help to rewrite the mathematical statement in a way that has the same logical meaning, yet that includes “if” and “then” in appropriate parts of the statement.</div> <div class="para">A note: you may recognize these statements, but it is completely OK if you do not recognize them. Naming the assumptions and conclusions is possible even if the statements are unfamiliar.</div> <ol class="decimal">

<li><div class="para">This is the most straightforward of the three statements in this activity. Most responses will probably have two hypothesis statements and one conclusion. It is possible to list even more assumptions, such as “a triangle is a right triangle,” “one leg of the triangle has length <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span>” and so on.</div></li>
<li>
<div class="para">This statement is roughly in “if-then” format already, with the “if” portion in the first sentence and the “then” portion in the second sentence.</div>
<div class="para">As a note: this statement is inspired by the Intermediate Value Theorem in calculus, but it is not exactly the Intermediate Value Theorem, as it does not state that we are restricting ourselves to values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(a \leq x \leq b\)</span> when stating that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> takes on every value between <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(b)\text{.}\)</span>
