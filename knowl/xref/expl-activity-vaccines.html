\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} \amp = - \beta S I \\

<div class="para">This change to the model reflects a concept we have observed in multiple chapters so far, from the Zombie Game to the definition of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> as applying to a population that is nearly entirely Susceptible.
