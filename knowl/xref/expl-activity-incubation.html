<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">The graph below shows data from a mumps outbreak at Bates College in the fall semester of 2016. Specifically, the data indicate numbers of students who have had mumps in this outbreak, counting them when they cease to be sick, to give values corresponding to the Removed compartment of a model. The curve displayed on the graph is the curve for the Removed compartment population in a typical SIR model that starts at the time when the first student would likely have first caught the mumps virus.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="external/MumpsDataWithSIR.png" class="contained" alt="Data points showing students recovering from mumps across time, and a curve showing the solution for the Removed compartment of an SIR model for mumps"></div>

<div class="para">Now suppose we build a second model. In this model, we account for the lengthy incubation period of mumps, which can be two weeks or more.

<li><div class="para">Consider how this model with incubation period fits the data points, and consider how the SIR model at the start of this Exploration fits the data points. Compare your observations of the two models and how they fit the data points. You can describe advantages and disadvantages of each model without selecting either as your preferred model, or you can select one model as fitting better, explaining how you made your selection.</div></li>
