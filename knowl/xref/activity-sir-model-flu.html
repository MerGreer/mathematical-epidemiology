<div class="para">Each academic year, many college campuses experience one or more outbreaks of influenza, also referred to as flu. According to the <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/keyfacts.htm" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),</a><details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="activity-sir-model-flu-1-1-2"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 8.2"><sup> 2 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="activity-sir-model-flu-1-1-2"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">www.cdc.gov/flu/about/keyfacts.htm</code></div></details> flu symptoms may include fever, chills, cough, aches, runny or stuffy nose, and more. Also according to the CDC, influenza spreads via tiny droplets when people sneeze or cough or talk, as well as when people touch surfaces that have the virus on them and then touch parts of their face such as the mouth, nose, and eyes.</div> <div class="para">To gather information about the incubation period of flu and about how long flu is contagious, visit <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/keyfacts.htm" target="_blank">this ``key facts’’ page from the CDC.</a><details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="activity-sir-model-flu-1-2-2"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 8.3"><sup> 3 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="activity-sir-model-flu-1-2-2"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">www.cdc.gov/flu/about/keyfacts.htm</code></div></details> To locate the range of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> values for typical influenza outbreaks, visit <a class="external" href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/2022/01/07/covid-19-and-influenza-surveillance" target="_blank">this page from the Virginia Department of Health.</a><details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="activity-sir-model-flu-1-2-5"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 8.4"><sup> 4 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="activity-sir-model-flu-1-2-5"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/2022/01/07/covid-19-and-influenza-surveillance</code></div></details> For all of these values that help with modeling, you are welcome to search online for other sources: the links provided here are sufficient, but are not the only way to gather the information we seek.</div> <div class="para">Use the idea of a campus outbreak to think about (at least) two ways to model isolation, guided by the prompts below.</div> <ol class="decimal" id="activity-sir-model-flu-1-4">
<li><div class="para">Choose either the SIR or SEIR model for the spread of flu. Use the online facts you have gathered to decide whether or not to include an incubation period in your model. Be sure to explain your reasoning. (There is not a right or wrong answer here: either choice can make sense, yet it is important to justify your decision using facts about the flu.) Provide the range of parameter values for each parameter in your model, and cite your sources. Remember to use a model without isolation, along with the basic reproduction number <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\text{,}\)</span> when computing <span class="process-math">\(\beta\text{.}\)</span> Then use this value of <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> when building a mathematical model that includes isolation.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">In many cases, people with the flu know they are sick and have the opportunity to isolate. Let us suppose that every person in an outbreak isolates after they have been sick for one day, and that they isolate perfectly. (This is unlikely in reality, but we can model this  to see the outcome.) Update your model accordingly, changing only the value of <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> (which relates to the time spent in the <span class="process-math">\(I(t)\)</span> population) so that people move more rapidly from compartment I to compartment R.</div></li>
<li>
<div class="para">Try your model in Python, using either the Python code for an SIR model, as in <a href="ch-model-analysis-and-the-basic-reproduction-number-R0.html#activity-formula-for-i-of-t-turning-around" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/activity-formula-for-i-of-t-turning-around.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Activity 5.4">Activity 5.4</a>, or the Python code for an SEIR model, as in <a href="ch-incubation-periods.html#activity-seir-model-play-with-kappa" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/activity-seir-model-play-with-kappa.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Activity 7.3">Activity 7.3</a>. Suppose there are 2500 students on campus, and update all parameters and time ranges in the model as needed. Feel free to try just one initial Infectious case, or a few (perhaps 2-10) initial Infectious cases, as it is possible for multiple people to become Infectious simultaneously in an influenza outbreak, perhaps because they all encountered the same Infectious person off-campus, or perhaps because some social event led to multiple initial infections within a very short time frame.</div>
<div class="para">First try your baseline model for influenza without isolation, and then try your influenza model with its updated <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> value to represent the complete isolation of Infectious people beginning one day after symptoms appear. Describe your results.</div>

<li>
<div class="para">There truly is no right or wrong decision here. Influenza is often modeled using the SIR model because the incubation period can be relatively short: the linked CDC page says influenza is most contagious for three days. However, the incubation period is not zero, and may be important to include when modeling a real campus outbreak and trying to estimate the timeline of the outbreak’s trajectory, and the CDC page also tells us that influenza can be contagious from one day before symptoms appear until five to seven days after symptoms appear, meaning a total of six to eight days. In summary: either model is a reasonable choice, and the decision rests on the modeler’s goals and the questions being asked when modeling.</div>
<div class="para">The contagion numbers listed above suggest that, without isolation, we may choose from a range of possible <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> values for our model, with <span class="process-math">\(1/8 \leq \gamma \leq 1/3\text{.}\)</span> The Virginia Department of Health tells us that <span class="process-math">\(1 \leq \mathcal{R}_0 \leq 2\text{.}\)</span> Putting these ranges of values and our population size of 2500 into our formula for <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> tells us that <span class="process-math">\(0.00005 \leq \beta \leq 0.000267\text{.}\)</span> (Be sure to confirm these numbers, using the correct <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> for the model you are using, and showing with <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> values used to compute the least and greatest values for <span class="process-math">\(\beta\text{.}\)</span>)</div>
</li>
<li><div class="para">If everyone knows they are sick, and everyone isolates perfectly after one day of illness, then we should set <span class="process-math">\(1/2 \leq \gamma \leq 1/1\)</span> or, more succinctly, <span class="process-math">\(1/2 \leq \gamma \leq 1\text{,}\)</span> for a complete isolation model in which the time unit is <em class="emphasis">days</em>. The range of <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> values is due to the possibility that flu can be contagious one day before symptoms begin, which would mean <span class="process-math">\(\gamma = 1/2\text{,}\)</span> or the possibility that contagion can begin close to when symptoms begin, which would mean <span class="process-math">\(\gamma = 1\text{.}\)</span>
