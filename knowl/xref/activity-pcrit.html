<div class="para">In this activity, we explore <span class="process-math">\(p_{\text{crit}}\)</span> through the comparison of two historically widespread diseases: smallpox and measles.</div> <ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">We begin by examining smallpox. Estimates for the value of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> for smallpox range from 3.5 to 6.<details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="activity-pcrit-1-2-1-1-2"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 6.4"><sup> 4 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="activity-pcrit-1-2-1-1-2">Estimates that <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0 \approx 3.5-6\)</span> come from the paper “Transmission potential of smallpox in contemporary populations” by Raymond Gani and Steve Leach, published in the journal <em class="emphasis">Nature</em> on 13 December 2001.</div></details> Given this range of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> values, what is the range of <span class="process-math">\(p_{\text{crit}}\)</span> values required in order to reduce the value of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}}\)</span> for smallpox so that <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}} \lt 1\text{?}\)</span> Suppose that a <span class="process-math">\(100\%\)</span> effective vaccine is available. What percentage of people would need to be vaccinated, using the values of <span class="process-math">\(p_{\text{crit}}\)</span> you computed, to prevent a smallpox outbreak, that is, to cause <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}} \lt 1\text{?}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Next, we examine measles. Many estimates for the value of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> for measles range from 12 to 18.<details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="activity-pcrit-1-2-2-1-2"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 6.5"><sup> 5 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="activity-pcrit-1-2-2-1-2">The paper “The basic reproduction number (R0) of measles: a systematic review”, by Fiona M Guerra, Shelly Bolotin, Gillian Lim, Jane Heffernan, Shelley L Deeks, Ye Li, and Natasha S Crowcroft, states that <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> is often approximated as <span class="process-math">\(12-18\text{,}\)</span> while also stating that the actual range of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> for measles varies even more. This paper was published in <em class="emphasis">The Lancet Infectious Diseases</em> on 27 July 2017.</div></details> Given this range of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> values, what is the range of <span class="process-math">\(p_{\text{crit}}\)</span> values required in order to reduce the value of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}}\)</span> for measles so that <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}} \lt 1\text{?}\)</span> Suppose that a <span class="process-math">\(100\%\)</span> effective vaccine is available.

</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Smallpox has been eliminated: the last natural occurrence was in 1977, and in 1980, the World Health Organization stated that smallpox had been globally eradicated. Measles has not been eliminated: widespread vaccination has reduced cases drastically in many parts of the world, but measles continues to circulate. Given your results in this activity about the values of <span class="process-math">\(p_{\text{crit}}\)</span> for smallpox and measles, write a few sentences about how <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> contributes toward making it more or less feasible to vaccinate enough people to eliminate a disease.</div></li>

<li><div class="para">For smallpox, <span class="process-math">\(0.71 \lt p_{\text{crit}} \lt 0.83\text{,}\)</span> meaning approximately <span class="process-math">\(71\% - 83\%\)</span> of people need to be vaccinated to prevent an outbreak.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">For measles, <span class="process-math">\(0.92 \lt p_{\text{crit}} \lt 0.94\text{,}\)</span> meaning approximately <span class="process-math">\(92\% - 94\%\)</span> of people need to be vaccinated to prevent an outbreak.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">This is open-ended. A typical answer may state that higher values of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> mean we need higher levels of vaccination. Answers may also investigate the reasons why it becomes so much more difficult to achieve higher levels of vaccination, especially on a global scale.</div></li>
