<div class="para">This activity describes a process for constructing a model to address how a government can best use its resources to reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS in its population. The real-life project that inspires this activity involved an excellent student who did meticulous research in constructing their model. The model shown below is a simplification of the model this student produced, yet still includes the key ideas.</div> <ul class="disc">
<li>
<div class="para">This model has three compartments and is similar in structure to an SIR model. However, the compartments here have the initials S, I, and A.</div>
<ul class="circle">
<li><div class="para">The S compartment is our familiar Susceptibles compartment, for people without HIV or AIDS.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The I compartment is for Infectious people, meaning those with HIV.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The A compartment is for people with AIDS.</div></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="para">Many modelers, at the time this student was working, indicated that patients with AIDS were typically too sick to spread the virus to others. Therefore patients with AIDS, according to models, did not contribute to new cases of HIV. The same hypothesis is part of this model: people in the I compartment can cause new infections, but people in the A compartment cannot.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">When someone in compartment I progresses in status from HIV to AIDS, they move to compartment A.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">This model lasts many years, so it includes births and deaths. All births are assumed to be Susceptible, and births occur at a constant rate <span class="process-math">\(\Pi\text{.}\)</span> The death rates can differ from compartment to compartment. The death rates are labeled <span class="process-math">\(\mu _S\)</span> for compartment S, <span class="process-math">\(\mu _I\)</span> for compartment I, and <span class="process-math">\(\mu _A\)</span> for compartment A.</div></li>
</ul> <div class="para">The compartmental diagram for this model appears in <a href="ch-getting-the-answer-right-in-modeling.html#fig-SIA-compartmental-diagram" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-SIA-compartmental-diagram.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 8.1">Figure 8.1</a>.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 70%; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/fig-SIA-compartmental-diagram-2.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="(Write this)"></div>

It may take some time to think through these pieces! <em class="emphasis">Begin by taking a significant amount of time to view the compartmental diagram in <a href="ch-getting-the-answer-right-in-modeling.html#fig-SIA-compartmental-diagram" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-SIA-compartmental-diagram.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 8.1">Figure 8.1</a> and read the ideas that led to the model’s development. Be sure you understand them.</em> Then respond to the following questions.</div> <ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">The student project that inspired this Activity examined government strategies for spending limited funds designated for public health. Write about at least four ways government funds could be used to address health-related issues connected with HIV and AIDS. Include funding for HIV/AIDS prevention as well as funding for the care of those who are sick.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">This student project had a goal of determining how government funds should be allocated, given a goal of reducing the number of new HIV infections as much as possible. For each way you described how government funds could be used, do your best to indicate how those funds would affect the model in <a href="ch-getting-the-answer-right-in-modeling.html#fig-SIA-compartmental-diagram" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-SIA-compartmental-diagram.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 8.1">Figure 8.1</a>. For example, the number of people in a compartment could be affected, or one of the rate parameters could be increased or decreased. Explain your reasoning.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Given a fixed amount of funding, and a goal of decreasing new HIV infections as much as possible, the results of this student project prescribed a very stark allocation of funding. Thinking through all the ways you thought funding could be used, and thinking about the stated goal of decreasing new HIV infections: can you guess what this student project found in its results?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Only after making a guess at the previous question:</em> check the Hint below to see what happened in this student’s project. Then consider carefully why this approach to modeling produced this answer, and give some examples of what would need to change in the modeling process in order to give a different answer.</div></li>
