<li><div class="para">Imagine an illness primarily affects children, who require hands-on care and may be near siblings or other people despite being sick.  Suppose that everyone who gets this illness experiences symptoms, and the symptoms are distinctive in a way that makes it clear the person has this illness. (Measles is an example of this kind of illness.) In this example, suppose everyone tries to isolate when their symptoms appear, but given the nature of the illness, there are still interactions with some relatives or other caregivers.

<li><div class="para">Suppose a residential campus experiences an outbreak of influenza. Some students experience high fevers, severe achiness, and other relatively extreme symptoms. These students rest and mostly isolate, but may have roommates or may need to interact with others while acquiring food or medicine. Other students have only a low fever and mild symptoms. These students continue with their daily routines, not resting much more than usual and not isolating.

<li>
<div class="para">First and most importantly: there is not a single right answer to this question. Any answer that is well-reasoned works.</div>
<div class="para">The author of this text would consider using a model like the one shown in <a href="ch-isolation.html#fig-SIR-incomplete-isolation-1" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-SIR-incomplete-isolation-1.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 8.3">Figure 8.3</a> in this situation. The reason is that all or nearly all people with such an illness would isolate, so we do not have anyone moving from I to R without passing through compartment J. Since families or other caregivers are likely to interact with sick children, there is a nonzero chance of disease spread, and historically, such illnesses have definitely spread in this way.</div>
<div class="para">An isolation model may or may not be needed here. Using a model such as that in <a href="ch-isolation.html#fig-SIR-incomplete-isolation-1" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-SIR-incomplete-isolation-1.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 8.3">Figure 8.3</a> may be most useful when isolation is implemented in a notably expansive or thorough way. A modeler should think about how much isolation is happening, what the modeling goals are, and whether a simpler model, such as SIR, might provide enough information.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="para">Again: there is not a single right answer to this question. Reasoning and justification are crucial to any response.</div>
<div class="para">One suggested answer is a model like that shown in <a href="ch-isolation.html#fig-SIR-incomplete-isolation-2" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-SIR-incomplete-isolation-2.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 8.4">Figure 8.4</a>. This model provides a J compartment to represent the students who do their best to isolate. However, these students may interact with roommates or may receive food deliveries or briefly emerge from isolation to go get food or medicine. Such interactions give a small but nonzero chance for influenza transmission, and the <span class="process-math">\(\delta J\)</span> in the transmission term, multiplied by <span class="process-math">\(\beta S\text{,}\)</span> represents this chance. The model in <a href="ch-isolation.html#fig-SIR-incomplete-isolation-2" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-SIR-incomplete-isolation-2.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 8.4">Figure 8.4</a> also shows that some students do not isolate at all. These students stay in compartment I while they are contagious, and they move to compartment R only after their Infectious time period ends.</div>
</li>
<li><div class="para">The transmission term can also be written <span class="process-math">\(\beta S I + \delta (\beta S J)\text{.}\)</span> (Check the algebra to confirm this yourself.) The <span class="process-math">\(\beta S I\)</span> portion is the same transmission term from our underlying SIR model. The other term has a similar form, <span class="process-math">\(\beta S J\text{,}\)</span> indicating transmission from the J compartment to the S compartment, but it is multiplied by a scaling factor <span class="process-math">\(\delta\text{.}\)</span> The value of <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> is typically between <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> A value of <span class="process-math">\(\delta = 0\)</span> would indicate no transmission from J to S, which was the case in our complete isolation model shown in <a href="ch-isolation.html#fig-SIR-complete-isolation-1" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-SIR-complete-isolation-1.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 8.1">Figure 8.1</a>. A value of <span class="process-math">\(\delta = 1\)</span> would indicate that transmission from the Isolation compartment is as likely as from the Infectious compartment, in which case we may have no reason to include an Isolation compartment. For values of <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> between <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> the larger the value of <span class="process-math">\(\delta\text{,}\)</span> the more likely it is for people in isolation to transmit the disease, yet it is still less likely than if they were not isolating at all. (In theory, <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> could be larger than <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> meaning people in compartment J would be <em class="emphasis">more</em> likely to transmit disease. While this seems unlikely when J means isolation, there could perhaps be a different outbreak and a different model in which some group of people is more contagious than those in the regular Infectious compartment, or there could be a behavior-based reason why one group is more more likely to transmit an illness than others.)</div></li>
