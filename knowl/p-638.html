<div class="para">The effective reproduction number is the average number of new infections caused by one infectious person in a population that is not entirely susceptible. The most common reason for a population to not be entirely susceptible is when some of the people have some form of immunity. Reasons for immunity may include vaccination and/or some of the people in the population previously having the disease being studied. The symbol <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}}\)</span> represents the effective reproduction number. (Chapter 6)</div>
