<div class="para">The approach used throughout this text is to dive into using, then building, disease models. We play with models and discover the ways each model responds to small and large changes. We represent the ideas of models using images, equations, words, graphs, and numbers. Each section centers on one or more activities, and as we work through these activities, we build up knowledge about how to construct and work with mathematical models of disease outbreaks.</div>
