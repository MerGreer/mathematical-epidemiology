<div class="para">As a reminder, the <em class="emphasis">basic reproduction number</em> <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> is the average number of new infections caused by one infectious person in an otherwise entirely susceptible population. This means that <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> is not a number we can use to directly describe a population that has been vaccinated against a disease, since a vaccinated population is not entirely susceptible. Instead, we introduce an <dfn class="terminology">effective reproduction number</dfn> <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}}\text{,}\)</span> which is the average number of new infections caused by one infectious person in a population that may not be entirely susceptible, such as a population that has had access to vaccination. One way to pronounce the symbol <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}}\)</span> is “R effective”.</div>
