<div class="para">How many people have had this illness at some point in time, according to this model with its default values? To answer this: notice that everyone who reaches the R compartment must have been sick at some time, so the long-term value of <span class="process-math">\(R(t)\)</span> provides the answer. Also notice that we need to make sure to run the model long enough that <span class="process-math">\(I(t)\)</span> reaches <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> Only then will <span class="process-math">\(R(t)\)</span> be evaluated at a large enough value of <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> for us to know the total number of people who become ill.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ch-vaccines-and-incubation-periods.html#li-183" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
