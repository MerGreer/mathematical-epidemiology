<em class="emphasis">Who is the expected audience for this book?</em> The audience I have in mind while writing is a class of undergraduates, studying together, and checking in with their professor along the way. These students have studied at least one semester of calculus, focusing primarily on derivatives as rates of change. It helps for students to also recognize that integrals and derivatives are inverse operations, to know that integrals sum up area under a curve (when all values on the curve are nonnegative), and to be familiar with the idea of computing derivative and antiderivative formulas. Some sections of this text use linear algebra, specifically matrices and eigenvalues. These sections are not required for learning from this book. Or, for students who would like to include these sections but have not studied linear algebra, there is a brief tutorial available.</div>
