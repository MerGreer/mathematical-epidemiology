<div class="para">Compare your answer above, regarding how many people get the illness at some time in the situation when <span class="process-math">\(p=p_{\text{crit}}\text{,}\)</span> with the initial number of Infectious people in the model. How many people must have gotten the illness sometime after the original Infectious people? Notice that this means that even when <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_{\text{eff}} \approx 1\text{,}\)</span> a significant number of additional people can contract the illness being studied. However, the Infectious population curve <span class="process-math">\(I(t)\)</span> does not rise: it instead appears as level or decreasing.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ch-vaccines-and-incubation-periods.html#li-185" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
