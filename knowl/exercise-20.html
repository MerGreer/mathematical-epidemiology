<div class="para">We make one more update to the pertussis model, addressing vaccine efficacy. Our inclusion of the multiplier <span class="process-math">\((1-p)\)</span> assumed that vaccination had <span class="process-math">\(100 \%\)</span> efficacy or effectiveness. However, research into pertussis vaccines shows that the level of vaccine efficacy or effectiveness can be significantly less. There is a wide range of values, depending on the specific vaccine used, the location in the world, and the years of study. For this exercise, we use a range of <span class="process-math">\(80-85\%\)</span> efficacy.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-48-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.9"><sup> 9 </sup></a>
