<div class="para">Next, try your changes in Python, creating before-and-after graphs. The code block includes sections titled “original model” and “your changes to the model”: scroll through to the “your changes to the model” version to make updates. Then go to the “plotting commands” section to choose the compartments for which you would like to show graphs; the default is to show I(t) for both the original and updated versions. Notice that if you were to show all four compartments, before and after, there would be eight total curves, which can be complicated for a reader to understand. Instead, prioritize the graphs that best illustrate your findings, probably showing no more than two or four total graphs at a time.</div>
