<div class="para">If you began with 49 humans and 1 zombie, these will be the numbers listed for Round 0. The data for Round 1 are computed by looking at the hex grid: each human that overlaps with a zombie is a “New Infection” and moves from the <em class="emphasis"># Humans</em> category to the <em class="emphasis"># Zombies</em> category. This means that this number of individuals is subtracted from <em class="emphasis"># Humans</em> and added to <em class="emphasis"># Zombies</em>. Double check that your count of new infections matches the app's count! In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-zombie-app-one-day.html" title="Figure 2.3">Figure 2.3</a>, the one zombie overlaps two blue X hexes. We therefore see that on Round 1 there are two <em class="emphasis">New Infections</em>. We also compare Round 1 with Round 0. The two <em class="emphasis">New Infections</em> for Round 1 mean that the population of “Susceptibles” (that is, humans) drops by 2, from 49 to 47, while the population of “Infectious” (that is, zombies) rises by 2, from 1 to 3.)</div>
