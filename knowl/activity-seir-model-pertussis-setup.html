<div class="para">We are now ready to set up a compartmental model for whooping cough, also called pertussis, in a fictional town having 10,000 residents, using information from the <a class="external" href="https://www.health.ny.gov/publications/2171/" target="_blank">New York State Pertussis or Whooping Cough Fact Sheet</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-47-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.8"><sup> 8 </sup></a>. The fact sheet says that the first stage of pertussis, in which symptoms are similar to those of a cold, lasts one to two weeks. Stage two, which includes the severe cough that gave pertussis the name “whooping cough”, lasts one to two months. The fact sheet also says that pertussis is contagious from the time cold symptoms appear until about three weeks after severe cough starts. The incubation period for pertussis is most often seven to ten days: the incubation period can sometimes be longer, but we focus on the most common lengths of time. We will not include the use of antibiotics in this model.</div> <ol class="decimal">
<li>
<div class="para">Use the SEIR model below. Determine as many parameter values as you can, using the information described from the fact sheet. In this model, assume that time is measured in days. It is appropriate for some parameter values to be a range of numbers, rather than a single number, since the fact sheet information includes ranges of time.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} \amp = - \beta S I \\
\frac{dE}{dt} \amp =  \beta S I - \kappa E \\
\frac{dI}{dt} \amp =  \kappa E - \gamma I \\
\frac{dR}{dt} \amp = \gamma I. 
\end{align*}

<li><div class="para">Run the Python code below, making sure to first enter the values from the parameter ranges you have computed for <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\kappa\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\text{.}\)</span> (These parameter values are set to 0 in the code, so visualizing the model requires you entering the values you determine.) Notice that the code will compute the appropriate value of <span class="process-math">\(\beta\text{,}\)</span> using the total population of 10,000 and the values you assign to <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\text{.}\)</span> Make observations about the outcomes of the model. Be sure to adjust the length of time the model runs, or to show just one or two solution curves at a time, or to otherwise alter the code so that you can best see and comment on the results of the model.</div></li>
