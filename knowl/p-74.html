<div class="para">In this book, we work with mathematical models. As a first step toward building mathematical models, we should think through the underlying “rules” of our situation. We should also think through any outcomes of these rules. Must these rules always lead to similar outcomes? Could these same rules produce significantly different outcomes? Spending time on understanding our system is a crucial part of making sure our mathematical approaches make sense.</div>
