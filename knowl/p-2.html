<div class="para">Welcome to Mathematical Epidemiology and More: A Course on Compartmental Models. It so happens that this book is becoming available well after the start of the global COVID-19 outbreak. During this pandemic, mathematics, data, epidemiology, graphs, models, and charts began appearing in the news and other media at levels beyond what we had ever seen before. To fully appreciate and act on the information in the media, it has been helpful to know first-hand the ways models can be built, used, and misused, and to understand the underlying mathematics involved.</div>
