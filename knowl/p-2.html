<div class="para">Yet this text's origin lies not in the COVID-19 outbreak, but in the much longer history of mathematical epidemiology. The text builds on a course that has been taught since 2014, and typical students studying these topics pre-2020 had never heard of connections between mathematics and epidemiology. Nearly all students in the course, before and since 2020, have gained their first significant introduction to disease models within this course. Examples of outbreaks we study include measles, Ebola, mumps, and whooping cough.</div>
