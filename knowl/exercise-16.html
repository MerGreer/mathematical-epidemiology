<div class="para">Redo <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/activity-seir-model-pertussis-setup.html" title="Activity 6.6">Activity 6.6</a>, but convert the time unit to <em class="emphasis">weeks</em> instead of <em class="emphasis">days</em>. To make this change, do the following.</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Compute the number of weeks for the incubation period of pertussis. This should be <span class="process-math">\(\mbox{(the number of days of the incubation period)} / 7\text{.}\)</span> When you then compute <span class="process-math">\(\kappa\text{,}\)</span> you should obtain a value equal to <span class="process-math">\(7 * \mbox{(the value you obtained in the previous exercise)}\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Similarly, the value of <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> in this exercise should be <span class="process-math">\(7 * \mbox{(the value you obtained in the previous exercise)}\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">For the graphs to appear the same, the horizontal axis should be adjusted. To be precise, the length of the new time axis should equal <span class="process-math">\(\mbox{(the length of the time axis in the previous exercise) } / 7\text{.}\)</span> To be close, use the nearest number of weeks. For instance, the default time length in the previous exercise is 365 days, which is one year. One year has approximately, but not exactly, 52 weeks. Using 52 weeks in this exercise will give a very similar graph to the 365-day graph from the previous exercise.</div></li>
</ol>
<div class="para">Explain mathematically why the unit conversions described in parts (a.), (b.), and (c.) are the correct conversions for converting the model's time scale from days to weeks. Show graphs from both this exercise and the previous exercise to demonstrate that the model results are the same when we convert the units of time. For better clarity: update the label for the time axis in each graph to say “days” or “weeks” instead of “time”, to make clear which time unit is being used in the graph.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ch-vaccines-and-incubation-periods.html#exercise-16" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
