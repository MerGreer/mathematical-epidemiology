<div class="para">In this text, we regularly represent the dynamics of an outbreak using both compartmental model drawings and systems of differential equations. When we are careful in how we draw our compartmental diagrams, we can use these diagrams interchangeably with their corresponding systems of differential equations. In this chapter, we learn the vocabulary of compartmental models, as well as ways to draw compartmental diagrams so they clearly and completely represent the information contained in their corresponding systems of differential equations.</div>
