<div class="para">Most diseases we know of have <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0 \gt 1\text{.}\)</span> This makes sense: without rising numbers of Infectious people, we do not experience an epidemic. However, in rare cases, a disease emerges for which <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0 \lt 1\text{.}\)</span> One example is MERS, which stands for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The first identified case of MERS was in 2012. There is still a lot to learn about MERS, but multiple estimates indicate that the value of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> for MERS is less than one.</div>
