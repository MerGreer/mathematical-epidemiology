<div class="para">Once you have addressed each question, write about your results. Include information about what question you asked and why it was a reasonable question, given the outbreak being studied. In addition to writing your response using words, incorporate other evidence, such as graphs and long-term values of Susceptibles or other compartments. Think throughout about structuring your response logically; indicating your priorities; explaining the change you made and why you made it; and explaining what happened when you made that change.</div>
