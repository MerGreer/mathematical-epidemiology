<div class="para">Imagine a new outbreak occurs in a small town of 5000 people. Let us suppose it makes sense to model this outbreak with an SIR model, where the compartments are Susceptible (people who are not sick but can become sick), Infectious (people who are currently able to spread the disease), and Removed (people who are no longer able to spread the disease and are unable to become sick again).</div> <div class="para">At the start of the outbreak, suppose a single person is Infectious, and the rest of the people are Susceptible. Further suppose that, in the early days of the outbreak, researchers estimate <span class="process-math">\(\beta \approx 0.0001\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\gamma \approx 0.2\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Compute the value of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> for this model. Then, based on the value of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> you compute, answer: what do you think will happen in the short term and in the long term of this outbreak?</div> <div class="para">Now suppose that the value of <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> was instead approximated to be <span class="process-math">\(0.00001\text{.}\)</span> Compute the value of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> in this case. With this value of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\text{,}\)</span> what do you anticipate for the short-term and long-term outcomes of the outbreak?</div>
