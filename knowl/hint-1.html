<div class="para">There are many ways to answer this. One consideration is that each of the differential equations involves both <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span> This means the differential equations do not stand alone: each depends on the other. This interrelationship means we cannot just compute two separate antiderivative formulas.</div> <div class="para">Another consideration is that the right-hand side of the differential equation in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exer-solve-de.html" title="Activity 3.2">ActivityÂ 3.2</a> involves only <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> that is, only the independent variable. The dependent variable <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> does not appear except in the derivative term <span class="process-math">\(dy/dt\text{.}\)</span> However, in the SI model system of equations, the dependent variables <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> appear in the derivatives <em class="emphasis">and elsewhere in the equations</em>. The antiderivative methods learned in a typical introductory Calculus course do not apply in this situation.</div> <div class="para">You may have thought of yet other challenges as well.</div>
