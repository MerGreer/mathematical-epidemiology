<div class="para">This activity describes a process for constructing a model to address how a government can best use its resources to reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS in its population. The real-life project that inspires this activity involved an excellent student who did meticulous research in constructing their model. The student incorporated the following ideas into their model, with each of the ideas drawing from professionally published articles.</div> <ul class="disc">
<li>
<div class="para">The model has five compartments.</div>
<ul class="circle">
<li><div class="para">The S compartment is our familiar Susceptibles compartment, for people without HIV or AIDS.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The I compartment is for Infectious people, meaning those with HIV, who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The I' compartment is for another category of Infectious people. This compartment is for people with HIV who are receiving antiretroviral therapy.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The A compartment is for people with AIDS who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The A' compartment is for people with AIDS who are receiving antiretroviral therapy.</div></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="para">Many modelers, at the time this student was working, indicated that patients with AIDS were typically too sick to spread the virus to others. Therefore patients with AIDS, according to models, did not contribute to new cases of HIV. The same hypothesis is part of this model: people in the I and I' compartments can cause new infections, but people in the A and A' compartments cannot.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">When people first have HIV, they are in the I compartment. If they later begin treatment, they move to the I' compartment.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">People can move back and forth between I and I', and between A and A'.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">When someone in compartment I progresses in status from HIV to AIDS, they move to compartment A. Similarly, when someone in compartment I' progresses in status from HIV to AIDS, they move to compartment A'.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">This model lasts many years, so it includes births and deaths. All births are assumed to be Susceptible. The death rates can differ from compartment to compartment.</div></li>
</ul> <div class="para">This model has many more pieces than the models we have seen before. It may take some time to think through all the pieces! Begin by taking a significant amount of time to view the compartmental diagram in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-ED-HIV-AIDS-model.html" title="Figure 7.1">FigureÂ 7.1</a> and read the ideas that led to the model's development. Be sure you understand them.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/image-16.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="(Write this)"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">7.1<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Compartmental diagram of a model of HIV/AIDS, using descriptions instead of formulas for each arrow</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">Once you have a solid understanding of the pieces of the model, you may begin to have insight into the outcome that emerged from this model. The student working on this project did all the research needed to determine biologically reasonable parameters. When running simulations with the model, their goal was to think through government strategies for spending limited funds designated for health. They hoped to determine how those funds should be allocated, given a goal of reducing the number of new HIV infections as much as possible.</div> <div class="para">Can you guess what they found?</div> <div class="para">Take time to think of what the model might have indicated, regarding the answer to the student's questions about government funds. Only after thinking about it: check the Hint below to see what happened. Then spend more time, thinking about why this model gave this answer, and thinking about what would need to change in the model to give a different answer.</div>
