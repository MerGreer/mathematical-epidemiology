<div class="para">Vaccine outcomes extend beyond affecting disease transmission. One common outcome is reducing the intensity of illness in individuals who have been vaccinated, yet who still become sick. This and other outcomes can be included in models, however such models tend to be more detailed than those we are studying right now. For this reason, this chapter focuses only on vaccine models that show reduced transmission.</div>
