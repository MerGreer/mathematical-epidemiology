<div class="para">Dear students working from this text: I hope you enjoy and learn a lot from these pages! My plan when writing has been to encourage active learning. This means that there are relatively few written explanations, along with lots of chances for you to try things on your own or with other students. The book is also filled with applications to real outbreaks and examples inspired by outbreaks, as well as applications to ideas that do not involve epidemics at all, but that can be represented by similar mathematics as what we use to study diseases. The types of mathematical models used in this text are used currently in the world, by people making decisions about public policy and for other wide-reaching goals, and I want you to emerge from using this text with a strong sense of what these models can, and cannot, tell us.</div>
