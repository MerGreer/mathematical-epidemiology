<div class="para">The word “sign” in sign analysis refers to whether terms in differential equations are positive (<span class="process-math">\(+\)</span>), negative (<span class="process-math">\(-\)</span>), or zero (<span class="process-math">\(0\)</span>). In sign analysis, we use these signs to build understanding of the differential equation. Often, our goal is to learn whether the solution to the differential equation is rising, falling, or level at some time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> This understanding may help us identify which solution curve goes with which differential equation, may show when a disease starts with an outbreak or can never experience an outbreak, and may indicate many other outcomes of models. Sign analysis is powerful because it depends only on the signs of terms, without forcing us to rely on detailed data sets that may not always be available. (Chapter 5)</div>
