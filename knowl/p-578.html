<div class="para">When COVID-19 first emerged, people had lots of questions, and data were being updated all the time. This was a disease that was truly new, and mathematical models were (and still are) a way to build understanding. Work through <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/activity-changing-models-COVID-19.html" title="Activity 7.7">Activity 7.7</a> to address some of the questions people immediately had about COVID-19. Importantly: the models in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/activity-changing-models-COVID-19.html" title="Activity 7.7">Activity 7.7</a> are inspired by the questions circulating early in the COVID-19 outbreak, but different regions throughout the world experienced COVID-19 in different ways, and the models here are not meant to address every circumstance. In other words: <em class="emphasis">the models here cannot fully and accurately represent early COVID-19</em>, as worldwide outbreaks were more complex. However, by considering public health interventions and changing models to examine the outcomes of these interventions, we learn more about how such interventions affect the trajectory of an outbreak.</div>
