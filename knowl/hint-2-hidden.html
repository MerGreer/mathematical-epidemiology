<div class="para">If your approach creates two separate sets of axes, try again.

Instead, we are (1) visually identifying what a good fit may look like, and (2) describing the features of a good fit, <em class="emphasis">from a visual perspective</em>. The features may be somewhat subjective: there is not likely to be a perfect fit, and different readers may have different priorities regarding how a good fit “should” look.</div>
