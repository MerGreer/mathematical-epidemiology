<div class="para">As we build a model, we focus on the relatively slow changes in population sizes that happen near the beginning and end of the model. This may not happen in every simulation: for instance, sometimes zombies happen to infect a lot of humans in the last time step. However, in other simulations, one lone human may last for many days before being infected. We focus on what happens <em class="emphasis">on average</em>. For this model, on average, the pace of infection seems slower near the beginning and near the end of the outbreak.</div>
