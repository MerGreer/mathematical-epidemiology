<div class="para">You may have noticed that the example in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/activity-priorities-HIV-AIDS.html" title="Activity 7.6">ActivityÂ 7.6</a> provides yet another important insight: <em class="emphasis">The results of a model may draw attention to assumptions we had not realized we were making.</em> Many researchers producing HIV/AIDS models were using models in which patients with AIDS did not contribute to new cases of HIV, so we used the same assumption. However, this led to a model whose outcome indicated that an optimal allocation of funds meant AIDS patients would receive no healthcare. This made brute logical sense, but it showed that we needed to update the model to have an expectation of healthcare for AIDS patients. <em class="emphasis">Models help us see situations in a new light. Even when a model's results are not what we hoped for, the process of modeling often improves our understanding of the system we are studying.</em>
