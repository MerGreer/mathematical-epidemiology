<div class="para">There may be other priorities as well, and we may not realize when we start model building that we are even building in those priorities. A student project I once advised produced one very powerful example of priorities that we do not see initially. This project forms the idea behind <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/activity-priorities-HIV-AIDS.html" title="Activity 7.6">ActivityÂ 7.6</a>. The goal of the project was to construct a model to address how a government could best use its resources to reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS in its population. The student based their model and their data collection on professional sources, using meticulous research. When the pieces were all in place and they began to use the model to optimize spending, <em class="emphasis">the results of the model showed</em> that the student's priorities had not been included in the model. This new understanding led the student to revise the model to better reflect their priorities.</div>
