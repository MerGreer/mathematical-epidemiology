<div class="para">These multiple forms of describing models all work together. They allow us to understand models and their results through graphs, equations, data, and diagrams. Now that we have these tools for discussing models, we take time to mathematically analyze models. Some of this analysis is necessary for confirming that our models make sense in relationship to the real world. Additional analysis of models gives us ways to think about controlling outbreaks.</div>
