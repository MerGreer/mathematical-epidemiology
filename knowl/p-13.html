<div class="para">Dear students working from this text: I hope you enjoy and learn a lot from these pages! My plan when writing has been to encourage active learning. This means that written explanations are kept to a minimum, and there are lots of chances for you to try things on your own or with other students. The book is filled with applications to real outbreaks; examples inspired by outbreaks; and applications to ideas that do not involve epidemics at all, but that can be represented by similar mathematics as what we use to study diseases. The types of mathematical models studied in this text are used currently in the world, by people making decisions about public policy and for other wide-reaching goals, and I want you to emerge from using this text with a strong sense of what these models can, and cannot, tell us.</div>
