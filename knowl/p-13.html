<div class="para">The chapters in this text are typically structured in a consistent way. The <em class="emphasis">Goals</em> of the chapter appear at the very start. After a brief introduction, an <em class="emphasis">Exploration</em> activity asks you to engage with questions that motivate the rest of the chapter. The sections within the chapter include some reading for you to do, and <em class="emphasis">Activities</em> appear frequently. It is best if you do these activities when they appear: later reading will assume you have already completed them. Some activities include hints or answers, and you will learn the most by completing as much of the activity as you can before checking the hints or reading the answers. At the end of each chapter, there are questions <em class="emphasis">For Further Thought</em> that provide deeper insights or additional examples of the chapter's ideas.</div>
