<div class="para">The first statement could be described as having one hypothesis or two hypotheses, depending on whether we characterize “six sides and six angles” as a single combined idea, or we prefer to split this idea into two separate hypotheses. There could be even more hypotheses listed, such as if we want to say that having a shape be a polygon is itself a hypothesis. Any reasonable answer here is valid: there is not just one way to designate hypotheses.</div> <div class="para">The second statement does not explicitly include the word “then”.</div>
