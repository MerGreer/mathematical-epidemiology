<div class="para">When zombies die, they leave the Infectious compartment and can no longer infect the Susceptibles. It is typical to represent these dynamics by introducing a Removed (R) compartment for the individuals who were zombies but have then become inactive. Our model then includes S, I, and R compartments, so we call it an SIR model. <aside class="aside aside-like"><div class="para">We typically say each of the letters in SIR when naming this model aloud. That is, we refer to the “S” “I” “R” model, not the “sir” model.</div></aside>  A compartmental diagram representing the dynamics of this SIR model appears in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-SIR-compartmental-diagram.html" title="Figure 4.3">Figure 4.3</a>.</div>
