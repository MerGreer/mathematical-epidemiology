<div class="para">The first statement could be described as having one hypothesis or two hypotheses, depending on whether we characterize “six sides and six angles” as a single combined idea, or we prefer to split this idea into two separate hypotheses. There could be even more hypotheses listed, such as if we want to say that having a shape be a polygon is itself a hypothesis.
