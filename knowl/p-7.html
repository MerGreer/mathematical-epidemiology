<em class="emphasis">What other kinds of math will we use, besides calculus?</em> To do mathematical modeling, we use any math we need.  We typically jump into activities and then introduce new mathematical ideas whenever they are helpful. These math ideas come from differential equations, multivariable calculus, linear algebra, numerical analysis, probability, proofs, and more. If you have already studied some of these subjects, you may be able to move more quickly through some of the activities. On the other hand, if you have not yet taken full courses in these subjects, then there will be enough information contained here for you to learn what you need and keep modeling. And, perhaps, you may find that you want to learn more, and that may lead you to study additional areas of mathematics.</div>
