<div class="introduction"><div class="para">So far, we have worked with the SI, SIR, and SEIR models. We have shown how to include vaccines in a model. And for those who completed the last exercise of <a href="ch-vaccines-and-incubation-periods.html#exercises-ch-vaccines" class="internal" title="For Further Thought 6.3">For Further ThoughtÂ 6.3</a>, we showed how to include vaccines along with their efficacy or effectiveness. Now, think through choosing from these models for different scenarios.</div></div>
