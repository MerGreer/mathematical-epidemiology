Both a table of data, and a graph of Round 0 and Round 1 data, appear to the right. A sample Round 1 result appears in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-zombie-app-one-day.html" title="Figure 2.3">Figure 2.3</a>, and the table of data is shown more clearly in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-human-zombie-data-day1.html" title="Figure 2.4">Figure 2.4</a>. There is randomness in how Zombies and Humans are placed on the grid, so your one-day results on the app may be different.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/ZombieApp_OneDay.png" class="contained" alt="Sample output for Round 1 from the Zombie Game App, including the grid of humans and zombies, plus a table and a graph of data for Rounds 0 and 1"></div>

The data for Round 1 are computed by looking at the hex grid: each human that overlaps with a zombie is a “New Infection” and moves from the <em class="emphasis"># Humans</em> category to the <em class="emphasis"># Zombies</em> category. This means that this number of individuals is subtracted from <em class="emphasis"># Humans</em> and added to <em class="emphasis"># Zombies</em>. Double check that your count of new infections matches the app's count! In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-zombie-app-one-day.html" title="Figure 2.3">Figure 2.3</a>, the one zombie overlaps two blue X hexes. We therefore see that on Round 1 there are two <em class="emphasis">New Infections</em>. We also compare Round 1 with Round 0. The two <em class="emphasis">New Infections</em> for Round 1 mean that the population of “Susceptibles” (that is, humans) drops by 2, from 49 to 47, while the population of “Infectious” (that is, zombies) rises by 2, from 1 to 3.)</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ch-zombies-can-math-help.html#task-4" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
