<div class="para">We are now ready to set up a compartmental model for whooping cough, also called pertussis, in a fictional town having 10,000 residents, using information from the <a class="external" href="https://www.health.ny.gov/publications/2171/" target="_blank">New York State Pertussis or Whooping Cough Fact Sheet</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-46-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.7"><sup> 7 </sup></a>. The fact sheet says that the first stage of pertussis, in which symptoms are similar to those of a cold, lasts one to two weeks. Stage two, which includes the severe cough that gave pertussis the name “whooping cough”, lasts one to two months. The fact sheet also says that pertussis is contagious from the time cold symptoms appear until about three weeks after severe cough starts. The incubation period for pertussis is most often seven to ten days: the incubation period can sometimes be longer, but we focus on the most common lengths of time. We will not include the use of antibiotics in this model.</div>
