<div class="para">It should be true that individuals are in exactly one compartment at a time, but with all claims such as this, you should convince yourself or else ask questions about it. It should also be true that individuals cannot progress in any order other than what the compartmental diagram shows. However, in some simulations, some individuals may not leave compartment S. By contrast, with <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/expl-activity-zombie-game.html" title="Exploration 2.1: Zombie Game">ExplorationÂ 2.1</a> and the SI model, all individuals progress from the S compartment to the I compartment.</div>
