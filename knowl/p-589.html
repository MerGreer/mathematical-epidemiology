<div class="para">Creating COVID-19 vaccines was an early goal, one that people were modeling long before vaccines became available.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-52-hidden.html" title="Footnote 7.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> The plan was for vaccines to address COVID-19 in multiple ways; we will address two such ways here. One way was for people to be less likely to get COVID-19. Another way was to reduce the severity or length of time ill for people who did get COVID-19. For each of these ways of addressing COVID-19: which compartments and/or parameters in the SEIR model are affected? Prepare before-and-after versions of the model, carefully defining each compartment and parameter in the before model and again in the after model. Then use the Python graph to generate graphs comparing the outcomes before and after vaccines.</div>
