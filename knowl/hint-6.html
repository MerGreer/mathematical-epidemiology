<div class="para">In the first two graphs, <span class="process-math">\(I(t)\)</span> rises, then falls. For a sign analysis, first write out the differential equation for <span class="process-math">\(dI/dt\text{.}\)</span> Then substitute in the values of <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> and the initial values <span class="process-math">\(S(0)=75\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(I(0)=25\)</span> to see that <span class="process-math">\(\beta S I - \gamma I \gt 0\text{.}\)</span> Yet <span class="process-math">\(S(t)\)</span> decreases rapidly, until <span class="process-math">\(\beta S I - \gamma I \lt 0\text{,}\)</span> and at this time the <span class="process-math">\(I(t)\)</span> curve falls.</div>
<div class="para">In the third graph, the <span class="process-math">\(I(t)\)</span> graph has a negative slope from the very beginning. A sign analysis shows why this makes sense, based on the initial value of <span class="process-math">\(dI/dt\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">In the first graph, everyone eventually gets sick. The long-term value of <span class="process-math">\(S(t)\)</span> appears to be <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and the long-term value of <span class="process-math">\(R(t)\)</span> appears to be <span class="process-math">\(100\text{,}\)</span> which is the total population.</div>
<div class="para">In the second graph, not everyone gets sick in the outbreak. The <span class="process-math">\(S(t)\)</span> curve appears to level out at a value of approximately <span class="process-math">\(8\text{.}\)</span> Extending <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">t_range</code> beyond <span class="process-math">\(t=20\)</span> can help for confirming this.</div>
<div class="para">In the third graph, quite a few people avoid illness. Estimates for long-term values of <span class="process-math">\(S(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R(t)\)</span> can confirm this.</div>
</li>
<li><div class="para">There is much to say here. In general, increasing <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> makes more people become sick, and makes infection happen more rapidly. Decreasing <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> leads to more infections. The <span class="process-math">\(S(t)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(I(t)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R(t)\)</span> graphs are all affected by these changes, and the answer to this prompt should include descriptions of these changes.</div></li>
