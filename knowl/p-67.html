<div class="para">As an alternative to make the game more interactive, the app allows you to choose your own locations for humans and zombies. To choose your own locations, under <em class="emphasis">Mode</em>, check <em class="emphasis">Hotseat</em> instead of <em class="emphasis">Auto</em>. The app then prompts you to place all the Humans for one round of the simulation. After all Humans are placed, the app prompts you to place your Zombies. For each Zombie, you must place the head and the arms. When this is complete, the app shows both Humans and Zombies, to indicate how many new infections have occurred. To make this into a game, two people can play. One person places the Humans, <em class="emphasis">without their partner watching</em>. Then the partner places the Zombies, again <em class="emphasis">without their partner watching</em>. Then, together, the partners can see how many new infections there are, once the Human and Zombie grids are shown together. Is there any strategy that helps either the Humans or the Zombies?</div>
