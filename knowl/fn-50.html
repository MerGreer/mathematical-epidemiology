</h5>In some parts of the world, there has been significant controversy about the use of vaccines. This book does not require readers to have any one opinion about vaccine usage. Questions about vaccines, here and elsewhere, can be addressed using models, and yet other questions about vaccines, including concerns, can also be modeled. Readers may wish to do just that, building models that represent different vaccine-based outcomes and using those models to determine outcomes and dynamics of COVID, with and without vaccines.</div>
