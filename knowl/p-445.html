<div class="para">Vaccine outcomes extend beyond affecting disease transmission. One common outcome is reducing the intensity of illness in individuals who have been vaccinated, yet who still become sick. This and other outcomes can also be included in models. However, such models tend to be more detailed than those we are studying right now. For this reason, we focus only on vaccine models that show reduced transmission.</div>
