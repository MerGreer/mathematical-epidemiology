<div class="para">This activity is motivated by the existence of diseases with <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0 \lt 1\text{.}\)</span> Suppose we study a disease for which <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0 \approx 0.5\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\gamma = 0.1\text{,}\)</span> that is, people are typically infectious for about ten days. Suppose we choose to model this disease with an SIR model similar to the models we have been using in this chapter: “S” stands for Susceptible, meaning people who are not sick but can become sick; “I” stands for Infectious, meaning people who are currently able to spread the disease, and “R stands for” Removed, meaning people who are no longer able to spread the disease and are unable to become sick again. In the case of a disease similar to MERS, the Removed compartment consists of both recoveries and deaths from the disease.</div>
