<div class="para">Another comment: though we have said our current SIR model probably refers to an outbreak over a relatively short time span, we purposely do not designate amounts of time that are “relatively short” or “longer”. This is a choice for the modeler. For each model, a human (the modeler, or perhaps a group working together) makes decisions about whether to list population changes based on length of time or other reasons. They then provide their decisions when describing their models, and they include some form of justification for each decision.</div>
