<div class="para">Because our models use continuous time and differential equations, we will sometimes compute non-integer values for the number of individuals in some compartments. We should think through this carefully. If, for instance, we find that at some time we have 13.6 Susceptibles and 36.4 Infectious, we are not saying that we have 13 Susceptibles, plus 36 Infectious, plus one individual who is split up to be 60% Susceptible and 40% Infectious. Instead, the differential equation model is telling us on average what happens, across many possible simulations or many possible outcomes. In computing an <em class="emphasis">on average</em> outcome, non-integer values are possible. If we wish to refer to actual numbers of people, we can round to the nearest integer, or use language that reflects the <em class="emphasis">on average</em> meaning of our model.</div>
