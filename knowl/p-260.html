<div class="para">In this diagram, we include the S and I compartments used previously, while also allowing the Infectious zombies to leave the I compartment and enter the R compartment, where they stay for the rest of the simulation. The mathematical formula for movement from I to R is <span class="process-math">\(\gamma I\text{.}\)</span> The parameter <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> (the Greek letter <em class="emphasis">gamma</em>) represents the rate at which individuals leave <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> and enter <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> Larger values of <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\text{,}\)</span> for instance, mean that zombies become inactive more rapidly than with smaller values of <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\text{.}\)</span> This formula indicates that neither Susceptibles nor Removed individuals influence movement from I to R: instead, only the number of Infectious people, and a rate based on how long they remain zombies, determine this movement between compartments.</div>
