<div class="introduction"><div class="para">This game uses a grid of 100 hexagons to represent a space in which humans and zombies interact. Each round of game play represents one day. For each day, each human (“Susceptible”) is represented on the grid by a blue “X” on a single hexagon. Each zombie (“Infectious”) is represented by three red dots connected by red lines, meant to suggest a head and two arms, each of which can infect a human. Each zombie spreads out across three connected hexagons. Sample hex grids, both unmarked and marked, appear in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/zombie-board-graphics.html" title="Figure 2.1">Figure 2.1</a>.</div></div>

<div class="para">To watch the outbreak unfold, day by day, first click <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">start</code>. You will see the zombies and humans placed randomly on the grid. Both a table of data, and a graph of Round 0 and Round 1 data, appear to the right. A sample Round 1 result appears in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-zombie-app-one-day.html" title="Figure 2.3">Figure 2.3</a>, and the table of data is shown more clearly in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-human-zombie-data-day1.html" title="Figure 2.4">Figure 2.4</a>. There is randomness in how Zombies and Humans are placed on the grid, so your one-day results on the app may be different.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/ZombieApp_OneDay.png" class="contained" alt="Sample output for Round 1 from the Zombie Game App, including the grid of humans and zombies, plus a table and a graph of data for Rounds 0 and 1"></div>

The data for Round 1 are computed by looking at the hex grid: each human that overlaps with a zombie is a “New Infection” and moves from the <em class="emphasis"># Humans</em> category to the <em class="emphasis"># Zombies</em> category. This means that this number of individuals is subtracted from <em class="emphasis"># Humans</em> and added to <em class="emphasis"># Zombies</em>. Double check that your count of new infections matches the app's count! In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-zombie-app-one-day.html" title="Figure 2.3">Figure 2.3</a>, the one zombie overlaps two blue X hexes. We therefore see that on Round 1 there are two <em class="emphasis">New Infections</em>. We also compare Round 1 with Round 0. The two <em class="emphasis">New Infections</em> for Round 1 mean that the population of “Susceptibles” (that is, humans) drops by 2, from 49 to 47, while the population of “Infectious” (that is, zombies) rises by 2, from 1 to 3.)</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h4>
<div class="para">When you are ready, click <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">next round</code> to see a new grid for Round 2. The table of data, and the graph, both update to include Round 2. Continue to click <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">next round</code> at your own pace, thinking through the grid, table, and graph as each step proceeds. The game ends when there are either no humans left to infect, or no zombies left to keep infecting new humans.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h4>
<div class="para">As an alternative to make the game more interactive, the app allows you to choose your own locations for humans and zombies. To choose your own locations, under <em class="emphasis">Mode</em>, check <em class="emphasis">Hotseat</em> instead of <em class="emphasis">Auto</em>. The app then prompts you to place all the Humans for one round of the simulation. After all Humans are placed, the app prompts you to place your Zombies. For each Zombie, you must place the head and the arms. When this is complete, the app shows both Humans and Zombies, to indicate how many new infections have occurred. To make this into a game, two people can play. One person places the Humans, <em class="emphasis">without their partner watching</em>. Then the partner places the Zombies, again <em class="emphasis">without their partner watching</em>. Then, together, the partners can see how many new infections there are, once the Human and Zombie grids are shown together. Is there any strategy that helps either the Humans or the Zombies?</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h4>
