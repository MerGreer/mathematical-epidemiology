<div class="para">The incubation period is usually 7 to 10 days, so <span class="process-math">\(\kappa\)</span> is in the range <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{10}- \frac{1}{7}\text{.}\)</span> (The incubation period can be shorter or longer, and if you included this information, you will have a wider range of values for <span class="process-math">\(\kappa\text{.}\)</span> This is also valid.)</div>
<div class="para">Pertussis begins to be contagious when cold symptoms appear, and the phase for cold symptoms is one to two weeks. Pertussis is most contagious for up to three weeks after the intense coughing phase begins. Adding these phases together, pertussis is contagious, or most contagious, for four to five weeks, meaning 28 to 35 days. So <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> is in the range <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{35}- \frac{1}{28}\text{.}\)</span> (Saying “up to” three weeks suggests people may not be contagious the full three weeks. And pertussis may be contagious, at a lower level, more than three weeks after severe cough begins. You may have built either of these facts into your answer, which may lead to a different answer.)</div>
