<div class="para">Smallpox has been eliminated: the last natural occurrence was in 1977, and in 1980, the World Health Organization stated that smallpox had been globally eradicated. Measles has not been eliminated: widespread vaccination has reduced cases drastically in many parts of the world, but measles continues to circulate. Given your results in this activity about the values of <span class="process-math">\(p_{\text{crit}}\)</span> for smallpox and measles, write a few sentences about how <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> contributes toward making it more or less feasible to vaccinate enough people to eliminate a disease.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ch-vaccines-and-isolation-in-compartmental-models.html#li-175" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
