<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Before trying this scenario in the app</em>, think through how zombie death, and different zombie lifespans, would change the outcomes of the simulation. In particular, think carefully about these questions:</div> <ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">What do you <em class="emphasis">expect</em> will happen if Zombies die, that is, they become inactive and unable to spread infection? Whether you feel very certain, or somewhat uncertain, articulate some outcomes that you think will occur with this game variation.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">How might your expected outcomes differ from those in the original model?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Outcomes might be measured by the table of data, by the graphs, by the timing of how infection spreads, by the numbers of survivors, or in other ways. For each of your expectations about how the outcomes may change, what support can you show for why this expectation makes sense?</div></li>
</ul> <div class="para">This exercise is not about right or wrong ideas, but instead is about building hypotheses, comparing the hypotheses with data, and developing deeper understanding of what the model shows.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ch-compartmental-diagrams.html#task-10" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
