<div class="para">Vary the zombie simulation so that zombies have only one arm. In this case, the app represents each zombie by two connected dots, rather than three connected dots. We can change the “# of Zombie Arms” in the app from 2 to 1. Complete one or more simulations with this change. Collect and graph the simulation data. How do your results compare with the results from simulations in which zombies have two arms? Write about your results. Include your data and graphs as part of your comparison.</div>
