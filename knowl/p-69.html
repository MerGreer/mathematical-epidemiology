<div class="para">This game uses a grid of 100 hexagons to represent a space in which humans and zombies interact. Each round of game play represents one day. For each day, each human (“Susceptible”) is represented on the grid by a blue “X” on a single hexagon. Each zombie (“Infectious”) is represented by three red dots connected by red lines, meant to suggest a head and two arms, each of which can infect a human. Each zombie spreads out across three connected hexagons. Sample hex grids, both unmarked and marked, appear in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/zombie-board-graphics.html" title="Figure 2.1">Figure 2.1</a>.</div>
