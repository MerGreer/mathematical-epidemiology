<body class="ignore-math"><div class="fn">In some parts of the world, there has been significant controversy about the use of vaccines for COVID-19.

We use models to address questions about vaccines, and readers are invited to do the same, building models that represent different vaccine-based outcomes and using those models to determine outcomes and dynamics of COVID-19, with and without vaccines.</div></body>
