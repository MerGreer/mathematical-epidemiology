<div class="para">The structure of mathematical statements typically involves “if” and “then” statements, such as: “<em class="emphasis">If</em> a polygon has six sides and six angles, <em class="emphasis">then</em> the polygon is a hexagon.” The “if” statements are called <em class="emphasis">assumptions</em>. The “then” statements are called <em class="emphasis">conclusions</em>. A mathematical statement may include multiple assumptions and/or multiple conclusions. The words “if” and “then” are not always included, so we as readers may need to think carefully about which parts of a mathematical statement are the assumptions and which parts are the conclusions.</div>
