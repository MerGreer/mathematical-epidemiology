<div class="para">The sections within the chapter include some reading for you to do, and <em class="emphasis">Activities</em> appear frequently. It is best if you do these activities when they appear: many activities contain new information, rather than just examples, and later reading will assume you have already completed the activities. Some activities include hints or answers, and you will learn the most by completing as much of the activity as you can before checking the hints or reading the answers.</div>
