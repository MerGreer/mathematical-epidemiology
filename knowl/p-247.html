<div class="para">When we use a compartmental diagram, we should carefully define and describe all our terms. The definitions and descriptions may change in different models, so we should not assume that <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(I\text{,}\)</span> or other variables always have the same meaning. Time, <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> may be measured in days, weeks, or some other unit, and we should indicate the unit. Here are possible descriptions for <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> based on the human–zombie game in <a href="ch-zombies-can-math-help.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: Zombies: Can Math Help?">Chapter 2</a>: <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> stands for the Susceptible population, meaning people who do not have the zombie disease yet but could become ill with this disease, and <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> stands for the Infectious population, meaning individuals who are currently contagious and currently showing symptoms of the zombie disease. In other outbreaks, and therefore in other models, these descriptions may change. As just one example, <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> in a different model may refer to individuals who are Infectious in the sense that they are contagious, but they may or may not be showing symptoms. Modelers should fully state the specific definitions of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(I\text{,}\)</span> or other populations, in their models.</div>
