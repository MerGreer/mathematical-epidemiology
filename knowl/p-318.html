<div class="para">In an outbreak that occurs over a relatively short time, it may make complete sense to say that the population is unchanging. It may be that the population truly does not change at all, or it may be that the population is changing so little that we decide not to include population change in a model of the outbreak. Noticing when population change is <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> or close to <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> allows us to write relatively simple models that do not try to incorporate births, deaths, immigration, emigration, or other population changes. Models that represent a longer span of time may need to account for changes in population.</div>
