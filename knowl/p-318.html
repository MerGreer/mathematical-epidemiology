<div class="para">Considering population change requires us to think more deeply about compartment R. We have referred to this compartment as “Removed”. Some models call the R compartment “Recovered”. In an outbreak where people all return to full health, calling the R compartment “Recovered” works well. In an outbreak that causes deaths, one modeling option is to include both deaths and recoveries in the same R compartment. In this case, the name “Removed” provides a better description. In either case, recognizing that “R” may stand for differently named compartments is a reminder to us about why we should fully describe each of our models, even if we believe SIR models are well known to our audience: even among SIR models, the interpretations can differ.</div>
