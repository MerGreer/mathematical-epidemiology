<em class="emphasis">What kind(s) of models will we use?</em> For most of this textbook, we use compartmental models, which can be drawn in pictures and written as ordinary differential equations. (It is OK to not know some of the terms in the previous sentence when you start: all will be explained.) Some of these models are called SIR models. We will mention other types of models, but we restrict our focus to compartmental models using ordinary differential equations so that we can fully understand the underlying math ideas, how to use the models, and how to visualize our results.</div>
