<div class="para">The example in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/activity-priorities-HIV-AIDS.html" title="Activity 7.6">Activity 7.6</a> is lengthy, but it provides an important insight. <em class="emphasis">We may think we know what questions we are answering with our models, but we should continue to interrogate our answers in relation to our goals, priorities, and ethics.</em> The outcome of the model in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/activity-priorities-HIV-AIDS.html" title="Activity 7.6">Activity 7.6</a> did not suit the goals or ethics of the student doing the project. The result from the mathematical model highlighted built-in priorities of the model that the student (and I) did not notice at first. When new infections are completely unaffected by the people in the A and A' compartments, then treating those people, or providing them any healthcare at all, is irrelevant to the goals of the model. However, leaving large numbers of people without healthcare was never the goal of this project. The model needed to be revised to account for this.</div>
