<div class="para">Students who take a course in modeling sometimes come from a mathematical background in which explanations are sparse. A question such as “What is the value of <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> times <span class="process-math">\(5~\text{?}\)</span>” may not require any explanation. (A more fun question might be, “What are two different ways to demonstrate that <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> times <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> equals <span class="process-math">\(15~\text{?}\)</span>”. How would your approach to responding change if the question were phrased this way?) My experience teaching a variety of math courses is that students have not always experienced the value of explanation, prior to a modeling course. We address this directly so that each student's models make the most sense, and the impacts of each model are as meaningful and powerful as they can be.</div>
