<div class="para">Imagine a new outbreak occurs in a small town of 5000 people. Let us suppose it makes sense to model this outbreak with an SIR model, where the compartments are Susceptible (people who are not sick but can become sick), Infectious (people who are currently able to spread the disease), and Removed (people who are no longer able to spread the disease and are unable to become sick again). At the start of the outbreak, a single person is Infectious, and the rest of the people are Susceptible.</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Suppose that, in the early days of the outbreak, researchers estimate <span class="process-math">\(\beta \approx 0.0001\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\gamma \approx 0.2\text{.}\)</span> Compute the value of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> for this model. Then, based on the value of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> you compute, answer: what do you think will happen in the short term and in the long term of this outbreak?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Now suppose that the value of <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> was instead approximated to be <span class="process-math">\(0.00001\text{,}\)</span> yet it is still true that <span class="process-math">\(\gamma \approx 0.2\text{.}\)</span> Compute the value of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> in this case. With this value of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\text{,}\)</span> what do you anticipate for the short-term and long-term outcomes of the outbreak?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Now suppose this outbreak occurs in a town of 1000 people, with <span class="process-math">\(\beta \approx 0.0001\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\gamma \approx 0.2\text{.}\)</span> Compute the value of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> for the SIR model in this smaller town. Use this value of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> to describe what you think will happen in the short term and in the long term of this outbreak.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Adapt the Python code shown earlier in this chapter to produce graphs of the outcomes of the SIR models in parts (a), (b), and (c) above. Write a few sentences about how well your descriptions of short-term and long-term model outcomes are supported, or not supported, by the graphs.</div></li>
