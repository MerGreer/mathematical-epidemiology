Putting together the information on these pages, construct a timeline of measles contagion in a single person, starting at the time the person is first infected. Include the following, and include whatever other information appears important.</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">How long does it typically take for a person to begin being contagious?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">How long is the total time period from when a person begins being contagious to when they no longer are contagious?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">How does contagion overlap, or not overlap, with when a person has the typical measles rash?</div></li>
</ol>
<div class="para">It is likely, for most diseases, that these timelines will involve ranges of time such as “3 to 5 days” rather than more specific amounts of time such as “4 days”. Time ranges will be helpful to us as we fine-tune our models.</div>
