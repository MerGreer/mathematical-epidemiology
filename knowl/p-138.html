<div class="para">The first two lines of the Python code are important, but their phrasing does not make very obvious what they do. Line 1 imports a Python package that includes commands for drawing plots. Line 2 clears any past plots, meaning any past plots should be completely gone. This makes sure that any new plot contains only what we want. Line 2 may not be needed when we very first use Python, but if we create a different plot, and then come back to this code cell and re-enter it, the other plot we created could be overlaid with this one. The “clear” command, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">plt.cla()</code>, makes sure that only our current plot appears.</div>
