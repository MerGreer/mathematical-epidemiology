<div class="para">For questions 2, 3, and possibly 4, first <em class="emphasis">imagine how changes to initial population values or parameter values can change outcomes in the model</em>. That is, truly think through this in your mind, and write down your thoughts, before proceeding with changes. For reference, the values in the original model are based very loosely on Lombardy, Italy, in early 2020. The total population was approximately ten million. The value of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> was estimated to be <span class="process-math">\(2.6-3.3\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\kappa\)</span> is estimated at about <span class="process-math">\(1/6.5\text{.}\)</span><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-56-hidden.html" title="Footnote 7.6"><sup> 6 </sup></a> The value of <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(1/14\text{,}\)</span> indicating an average of two weeks of being infectious. This is based on many reports suggesting that most people were infectious for one to two weeks, but that some people were infectious for much longer. There was vast variation on how early COVID-19 affected people, which is part of the reason we need to consider changes and updates to models.</div>
