<div class="para">When we say “mutually distinct”, we mean that at any moment in time, an individual is in exactly one compartment: no more, no fewer. This means our entire population is fully accounted for at all times because everyone appears in some compartment. We also notice that we cannot double-count individuals, as they cannot be in more than one compartment at a time.</div>
