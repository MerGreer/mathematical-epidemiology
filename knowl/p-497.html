<div class="para">Now that we have discussed public health intervention in the form of vaccines, as well as SI, SIR, and SEIR models, we have learned enough to be able to mathematically model the primary dynamics of many disease outbreaks. <em class="emphasis">These ideas are the core of this course.</em> In <a href="ch-getting-the-answer-right-in-modeling.html" class="internal" title='Chapter 7: Getting the Answer "Right" in Modeling'>Chapter 7</a> we will think through the big ideas inherent in mathematical modeling. The remaining chapters in <a href="part-core-modeling-concepts.html" class="internal" title="Part I: Core Modeling Concepts">Part I</a> focus on connecting data with models and working with two additional ways to significantly extend our use of compartmental models: endemic disease, in <a href="ch-epidemic-vs-endemic-models.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 9: * Epidemic vs. Endemic Models">Chapter 9</a>, and modeling ideas other than diseases, in <a href="ch-modeling-the-spread-of-a-rumor.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 12: * Modeling the Spread of a Rumor">Chapter 12</a>.</div>
