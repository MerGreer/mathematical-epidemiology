<div class="para">The term <span class="process-math">\(\beta SI\)</span> indicates flow from <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span> This term indicates that the flow depends on both the population <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> and the population <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span> When either population is very small, flow is relatively small. When both populations are relatively large, their product is large and therefore flow is relatively large. This sort of term is called a <em class="emphasis">mass action</em> term, from the Law of Mass Action in chemistry. The idea of mass action is just one way to model flow from one compartment to another; we will study other formulas for flow.</div>
