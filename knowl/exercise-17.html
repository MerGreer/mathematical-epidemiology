<li><div class="para">Compute <span class="process-math">\(p_{\text{crit}}\)</span> for pertussis, using the information that <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> for pertussis can be between 5.5 and 17, depending on the outbreak. Your results for <span class="process-math">\(p_{\text{crit}}\)</span> will be a range of values.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Adapt the Python code from the second exercise to run the model with a vaccine level at least as large as <span class="process-math">\(p_{\text{crit}}\text{.}\)</span> Adjust the time scale, show just some of the solution curve graphs, or make any other changes needed, to best see the long-term outcome of the model. Write your observations of the outcomes of this model, and compare and contrast with the no-vaccine model.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Do some online research to determine the percentage of children in your area, or percentage of all people in your area, who are vaccinated against pertussis. “Your area” can refer to your city, state, province, country, or whatever other region you choose. Run the Python code again, using this percentage for vaccination, and citing the resources in which you found the percentage. Adjust the code as needed so you can best see the results, and describe your findings.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">In approximately 2019, researchers found that the whooping cough vaccine had become less effective over time, for a variety of reasons. They investigated the reasons and made changes. Read about this in from at least three sources, including general news sources as well as government-led websites, and report on your findings.</div></li>
