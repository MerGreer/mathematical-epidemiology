<div class="para">Ask some questions of your model. Two sample questions are, “What happens if the campus vastly increases its number and distribution of hand sanitizing stations?” and “How much do the model's results change as the initial number of infectious people changes?”. There are many other questions you can ask. Use Python code blocks from elsewhere in the text to answer your questions. Select a code block that includes the type of model you are using (such as SIR, SEIR, and possibly vaccination) and make whatever changes you need.</div>
