<div class="para">Notice the arrow labeled <span class="process-math">\(\kappa E\text{.}\)</span> The flow out of the E compartment depends only on the population <span class="process-math">\(E(t)\)</span> and the amount of time typically spent as Exposed-and-incubating, similar to how the flow out of the I compartment in the SIR and SEIR models depends only on the population <span class="process-math">\(I(t)\)</span> and the amount of time spent as Infectious. An important comment here is that this answer key uses the parameter <span class="process-math">\(\kappa\)</span> for the rate governing the flow out of the E compartment, but there is no reason at all that you should have chosen the Greek letter <span class="process-math">\(\kappa\)</span> for this rate! Whatever letter you chose, as long as it is not a letter already in use elsewhere in the model, is an excellent choice.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ch-vaccines-and-incubation-periods.html#li-194" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
