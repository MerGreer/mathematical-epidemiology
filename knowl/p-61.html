<div class="para">Why do we start with a simulation? First, this course requires active involvement, so we create space immediately for that involvement. Second, this simulation game can be interactive, and working with others helps us see other perspectives and adds both fun and community to learning. Third, though we mostly work with real-life outbreaks in this textbook, we also purposely diverge from reality to think through hypothetical outcomes, and zombies are one way to think creatively about disease spread. Fourth, this activity generates outbreak examples, and examples throughout this course are one of our main ways to build toward theory and illustrate abstract concepts. Therefore, to achieve the goals for each section, we usually begin with exploration activities, then use what we learned in the explorations to help build our mathematical framework.</div>
