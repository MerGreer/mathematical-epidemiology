<article class="li"> <div class="para">Parameters in a model are numbers, determined using biological information, that represent some aspect of how a disease progresses. In this text, most parameters are shown as Greek letters, such as <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\text{.}\)</span> A few parameters in this text represent percentages, such as the percentage of a population that is vaccinated against a disease, and these parameters are typically represented by lowercase letters such as <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(q\text{.}\)</span> Parameters are different than variables: the variables in our models are typically the independent variable <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> for time, and dependent variables such as <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(I\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> and others, for populations.
