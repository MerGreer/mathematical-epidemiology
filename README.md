# PreTeXt Codespace

Use this template repository to quickly start a new [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org) project entirely in the cloud, using GitHub Codespaces.

To start, look for the green button at the top right of this page.  If the button says `Use this template`, then you are ready to create a new repository for your project.  Click on the button and select "Create a new repository".  On the next page, give your project a name, select public or private (this can be changed later), and click the "Create repository from template" button.

Once you have done this, you will see this same README, but now the green button at the top of the page will say `<> Code`.  

1. Click on this button. 
2. Click on the tab that says "Codespaces"
3. Click "Create codespace on main".

This take a minute or two (just the first time you do it; later this will be much faster) and then open a browser version of VS Code with everything set up to start working.  It will generate a new pretext book (and replace this README with one you can edit for your project).
